The index specifically focuses on foreign workers and expats in their rankings.\n\nAsia takes the prize\n\nIt is safe to call Asia the most expensive continent, with five cities ‚Äì Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Seoul ‚Äì landing in the top 10.\n\nSome regulators include the Middle East in Asia. In that case, Tel Aviv ‚Äì which is in sixth place ‚Äì also counts toward Asia‚Äôs total and would give it six out of 10 spots.\n\nAsia also claims the honor of being home to the fastest-rising city on the overall list. That would be Colombo, Sri Lanka‚Äôs main metropolis, which jumped 23 places from 162 to 149.\n\nLee Quane, ECA‚Äôs regional director for Asia, explained the reasoning for mainland China‚Äôs growing presence on the index.\n\n‚ÄúThe majority of the mainland Chinese cities in our rankings have higher rates of inflation than we are used to seeing, but they are still typically lower than elsewhere in Asia,‚Äù Quane said in a statement. ‚ÄúTherefore, the main reason for their rise in the rankings has been the continued strength of the Chinese yuan against other major currencies.‚Äù\n\nHong Kong's competitive and cramped housing market contributed to its \"most expensive\" ranking. Li Zhihua/China News Service/Getty Images\n\nLower down the list\n\nSo, which cities are lower ranked than in previous years?\n\nParis, which has topped the ECA list in the past, dropped out of the top 30. Madrid, Rome and Brussels all fell as well.\n\n‚ÄúNearly every major Eurozone city saw a drop in the rankings this year as the euro performed worse in the last 12 months than the US dollar and British pound,‚Äù Quane explains.\n\nExternal factors like politics and international conflicts can also play a role. Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and the accompanying sanctions placed by many countries meant that Moscow came in 62nd place and St Petersburg landed in 147th.\n\nEurope‚Äôs most expensive city is Geneva, Switzerland, which was in third place after Hong Kong and New York City. Switzerland uses the Swiss franc instead of the euro.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has, of course, played a role in global supply chains and other economic factors.\n\nOther rankings\n\nECA International isn‚Äôt the only company that ranks the world‚Äôs cities based on economics.\n\nLondon-based Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) releases its Worldwide Cost of Living index every December. In 2021, Tel Aviv took the prize for costliest place to live, with Paris and Singapore tying for second.\n\nHong Kong was in the fifth spot, behind Zurich. In 2020, Hong Kong, Zurich and Paris all shared the designation of number one.\n\nBoth lists use the prices of everyday items like groceries and fuel to determine their rankings. However, EIU ties its figures to the US dollar, so economies that do the same thing ‚Äì like Hong Kong, for one ‚Äì are more likely to rank highly.\n\nEither way, regardless of the order cities are listed on different indexes, it‚Äôs clear that Asian, European and North American cities are far more expensive to live in than their counterparts in Africa and South America.\n\nNew York was the only North American city to place in the top ten.

Residents in San Francisco have been contending with a rise in burglaries and car thefts, as well an alarming spate of hate crimes directed against Asian Americans. Los Angeles residents have witnessed a sharp increase in violent crime, while city leaders have been grappling with a homelessness crisis that has led to the proliferation of tents and trash across parks, sidewalks and public spaces, while exposing an untreated mental health emergency on their streets.\n\nOn Tuesday, San Francisco voters registered their disquiet by recalling District Attorney Chesa Boudin amid concern that he was advancing progressive policies as a national criminal justice reform advocate at the cost of their safety. It was a move that signaled just how far the political pendulum has swung since the 2020 election cycle when many Democratic voters cited police accountability and criminal justice overhauls among their top concerns ‚Äì a debate that reached a crescendo following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nOn the same night, voters in the overwhelmingly progressive city of Los Angeles signaled their unease with Democrats‚Äô handling of crime and homelessness by elevating billionaire shopping mall magnate Rick Caruso, a former Republican who became a Democrat earlier this year, into a runoff race to replace term-limited Mayor Eric Garcetti.\n\nSix-term US Rep. Karen Bass was once viewed as the frontrunner in the mayor‚Äôs race, but Caruso mounted an unexpectedly strong challenge against her, spending $40 million to push the argument that city leaders have failed to keep people safe and have proven inept in finding solutions to house some 41,000 people living on the streets.\n\nBass, a Democrat who led the House negotiations on legislation to increase police accountability after Floyd‚Äôs death, has promised to make public safety a priority. She pledged to restore the Los Angeles Police Department to its authorized force of 9,700 officers, in part by hiring more civilians to free up 250 officers to return to street patrols. But she has not gone as far as Caruso, who has promised to hire 1,500 additional officers and to bring on some 500 sanitation workers to clean up the streets ‚Äì proposals that his critics say the city cannot afford.\n\nFor months now, the crosswinds facing Democrats nationally as they struggle to find an effective message on crime and inflation have been apparent in races across California, where Democrats currently hold all the statewide offices and dominate the congressional delegation.\n\nThe new map that was drawn by the state‚Äôs nonpartisan redistricting commission last year yielded as many as ten competitive House races in California, where Democrats were bullish about the potential for pickups.\n\nBut those ambitions have been tempered by the fact that Golden State voters are contending with the highest gas prices in the nation, unsettled by the spike in violent crime and frustrated by the fact that they see no improvement in homelessness even though billions of dollars are flowing to build housing and shelters. All those issues have surfaced in close races in the state, emboldening Republicans who are advancing the notion that Democratic policies are leading to chaos.\n\nThe low turnout in Tuesday‚Äôs elections in California and New Jersey was another sign that Democrats are failing to energize their voters in states that will be key to their hopes of holding control of Congress.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear Elizabeth Warren's plan to avoid an election loss for Democrats 01:19 - Source: CNN\n\nDespite an array of competitive House races ‚Äì where the top two vote-getters regardless of party will advance to the general election ‚Äì only 19% of California ballots had been returned as of Tuesday even though they were mailed to nearly 22 million voters weeks ago, according to ballot tracking data from the California-based firm Political Data Intelligence.\n\nVoters also cast ballots in Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico and South Dakota on Tuesday in primary contests that offered a window into how much voters intend to blame the party in power for their dissatisfaction about the state of the economy and the country.\n\nSeveral California Republican incumbents faced their own challenges as the various factions of the GOP continue to wrestle for dominance. Rep. David Valadao, one of ten GOP members who supported Trump‚Äôs 2021 impeachment, faced a challenge on his right in his Democratic-leaning Central Valley seat ‚Äì the new 22nd District. Former Fresno City Councilmember Chris Mathys said he decided to run because of Valadao‚Äôs impeachment vote, but Trump has not gotten involved in the race.\n\nGOP Rep. Young Kim confronted strong competition from her right flank in the newly drawn 40th District in Orange County from Marine veteran Greg Raths, another Trump loyalist.\n\nOn the flip side, Democrats hope to use GOP Rep. Mike Garcia‚Äôs ties to Trump against him in California‚Äôs 27th District after redistricting made his northern Los Angeles County seat more Democratic. (Garcia voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election results in Arizona and Pennsylvania.) Former state Assemblywoman Christy Smith, a Democrat, will advance to a runoff in the district with Garcia, CNN projected.\n\nIowa Democrats delivered an upset on Tuesday night by rejecting a onetime star in the party, former Rep. Abby Finkenauer, in her bid to take on veteran GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley in November.\n\nFollowing Finkenauer‚Äôs recent blunder ‚Äì where she almost failed to qualify for the ballot when a judge found that she had not met the signature requirements ‚Äì as well as her loss two years ago to Republican Rep. Ashley Hinson, Democrats in the Hawkeye State went in a different direction. They chose retired Navy Adm. Mike Franken to go up against Grassley, the longest-serving Republican in the US Senate, who will win his party‚Äôs primary as he seeks an eighth term, CNN projected.\n\nFinkenauer served for one term in Congress after she won a district in 2018 that former President Donald Trump had carried two years earlier. At that time, she was the second-youngest woman ever elected to Congress, at the age of 29.\n\nElsewhere in Iowa, one of the most competitive races is in the 3rd District, where Rep. Cindy Axne, the only Democrat in the congressional delegation, hopes to hold her seat in a district that Trump would have won by less than half a point. CNN projected that state Sen. Zach Nunn, an Air Force veteran, will win the Republican primary in the Des Moines-area district.\n\nThe other two competitive House races in Iowa are set. GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks will face Democratic state Rep. Christina Bohannan in the new 1st District. In the 2nd District, Hinson will face Democratic state Sen. Liz Mathis, who is also a former local TV news anchor.\n\nThere were also several high-profile congressional races in New Jersey. In the state‚Äôs 7th District, a battleground that became more Republican in redistricting, CNN projected that Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski and Republican Tom Kean Jr., the former state Senate minority leader and son of former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean, will face off in the general election.\n\nIn the 8th District in northern New Jersey, Democrat Rob Menendez Jr., son of New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, will win the Democratic primary, CNN projects, as he runs for the seat of retiring Democratic Rep. Albio Sires.\n\nGOP Rep. Chris Smith, who voted for the bipartisan infrastructure bill, fended off an array of primary challengers in the 4th District in central New Jersey, including Mike Crispi, a talk show host endorsed by Trump allies such as Roger Stone and Rudy Giuliani.\n\nIn Montana, Trump backed his former Interior secretary Ryan Zinke ‚Äì despite his history of controversy ‚Äì as the candidate attempts to return to Congress. The state won a second congressional seat following the 2020 census results. Zinke faced four other candidates in the GOP primary, including former state Sen. Al Olszewski and pastor Mary Todd, as questions swirl about Zinke‚Äôs residency.\n\nIn South Dakota, Rep. Dusty Johnson will win the GOP primary for the state‚Äôs only congressional seat, CNN projected. He faced a primary challenge after voting to certify the 2020 presidential election results. CNN also projected that South Dakota GOP Gov. Kristi Noem, a potential 2024 contender, will defeat her primary challenger, state Rep. Steven Haugaard, who had accused her of being insufficiently conservative and spending too much time as governor tending to her ambitions for higher office.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Maeve Reston"], "publish_date": "2022/06/07"}]}

This includes Trump‚Äôs attempts to overturn his 2020 defeat by pressuring state and federal officials, and what committee members say was his ‚Äúdereliction of duty‚Äù on January 6 while his supporters ransacked the US Capitol.\n\nLawmakers will try to convict Trump in the court of public opinion ‚Äì which is all they can do, because it‚Äôs not within their powers to actually indict Trump. But they have an emerging legal foundation to claim that Trump broke the law, thanks to a landmark court ruling from a federal judge who said it was ‚Äúmore likely than not‚Äù that Trump committed crimes regarding January 6.\n\nThese highly choreographed hearings will be the panel‚Äôs first opportunity to show the public what they‚Äôve learned from more than 1,000 witness interviews and 135,000 documents. An avalanche of new information about January 6 has come to light since Trump‚Äôs impeachment trial in February 2021, where he was acquitted of one count of ‚Äúincitement of insurrection.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe are going to tell the story of a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 presidential election and block the transfer of power,‚Äù Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who serves on the committee, told the Washington Post earlier this week, adding that the committee ‚Äúhas found evidence of concerted planning and premediated activity‚Äù related to the events of January 6.\n\nHere‚Äôs a breakdown of what the panel ‚Äì and the press ‚Äì unearthed about Trump‚Äôs leadership role in the anti-democratic scheme, and how it all fits into the ongoing criminal investigations.\n\nTrump‚Äôs election subversion before January 6\n\nThe committee has interviewed officials from Michigan and Georgia, among other states, where Trump unsuccessfully tried to cajole local officials into nullifying Biden‚Äôs votes and name him the winner. Trump also tried to enlist senior Justice Department officials to assist with these efforts.\n\nLawmakers have also dug into the ‚Äúfake electors‚Äù plot, which was led by Trump campaign officials and was an attempt to undermine the Electoral College process in December 2020.\n\nCongressional investigators have obtained hundreds of emails from right-wing attorney John Eastman, who directly advised Trump to pursue legally dubious methods to stay in office. This included a plan for then-Vice President Mike Pence to throw the election to Trump on January 6 while presiding over a joint session of Congress to certify Biden‚Äôs Electoral College victory.\n\nIn another victory for the committee, the judge in Eastman‚Äôs civil case said Tuesday that the potentially criminal scheme between Trump and Eastman to obstruct the Electoral College proceedings was formed in December 2020, weeks earlier than previously established. The ruling paves the way for the panel to get additional emails that Eastman tried to keep secret.\n\nTrump and his allies pushed ahead with these efforts, and promoted the ‚ÄúBig Lie‚Äù, even after he was told by top officials, including then-Attorney General Bill Barr, that the election results were legitimate and that he lost. Even Eastman acknowledged in emails at the time that his plans were not legally sound. Lawmakers have said this suggests Trump had a corrupt state of mind.\n\n‚ÄúThe data is going to be compelling from the committee,‚Äù former Rep. Denver Riggleman, who was a Republican advisor to the committee, said on CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnderson Cooper 360¬∞‚Äù last week. ‚ÄúI think it is up to the American people, after that is presented, to come up ‚Äì using facts, not fantasies or opinions ‚Äì on what the culpability of the President is, and the people around him.‚Äù\n\nTrump, Eastman and the other GOP figures who were involved have denied wrongdoing. Spokespeople for Trump did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nTrump‚Äôs dereliction of duty during the Capitol riot\n\nOnce Trump failed to stop states from certifying their results, he started focusing on January 6 as his last chance to cling to power. The facts of that tragic day are well-known, but the panel is going to attempt to drive home a clear narrative from the chaos: Trump knew his supporters could get violent, but egged them on anyway, and was derelict when he didn‚Äôt do try to stop the violence.\n\n‚ÄúThey were warned that January 6th could, and likely would, turn violent,‚Äù Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the Republican vice chairwoman of the panel, said at a committee hearing in March.\n\nPence‚Äôs staffers were so concerned before January 6 that they warned the US Secret Service that Trump might stoke violence against him, because he wasn‚Äôt willing to overturn the election, according to The New York Times. (The Secret Service has since claimed it has ‚Äúno knowledge‚Äù of that conversation happening.) Some of Pence‚Äôs senior advisers, who have cooperated with the committee‚Äôs inquiry, could potentially be called as witnesses during the public hearings.\n\nProminent Republican officials and right-wing media figures knew in real-time that only Trump could call off the mob and bring an end to the deadly carnage at the Capitol, according to text messages that these Trump allies sent to Trump‚Äôs chief of staff Mark Meadows on January 6. CNN obtained his texts after he partially complied with a subpoena to turn over the messages.\n\nDespite those pleas, according to committee members, Trump spent 187 minutes during the riot watching TV and working the phones, seemingly pleased with how his supporters were fighting for him at the Capitol. He reacted approvingly when he learned that some of the rioters were chanting ‚Äúhang Mike Pence,‚Äù according to testimony that the panel got from a Meadows aide.\n\nTo zero in on these crucial hours inside the White House, the panel interviewed people who were there with Trump that day, including his daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. Clips of their videotaped depositions will likely be played at the public hearings for the first time ‚Äì which are just some of the never-before-seen details that lawmakers have teased.\n\nTrump under criminal investigation in Georgia\n\nThe hearings will likely delve into one of the most infamous episodes from Trump‚Äôs attempts to subvert the election: His phone call with Georgia‚Äôs top election official, where Trump falsely claimed that the election was rigged and pleaded with him to ‚Äúfind‚Äù enough votes to let him win.\n\nThe explosive call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger was serious enough to trigger a criminal investigation by state prosecutors in Atlanta. The district attorney there has convened a special grand jury and has started issuing subpoenas, and has broadened the probe to also look at the ‚Äúfake electors‚Äù plot to subvert the results in Georgia.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat, has said she‚Äôs not adhering to a political schedule with her investigation and will follow the facts wherever they lead. Trump has denied wrongdoing. The probe is widely considered one of the gravest ongoing legal threats to Trump.\n\nWill Justice Department probe ever reach Trump?\n\nFederal investigators have feverishly rounded up more than 800 alleged rioters, making arrests in almost every state. But the question remains (especially among Democrats): Will the Justice Department go after Trump?\n\nThere are some signs that prosecutors are moving up the food chain. FBI agents interviewed Republicans in Michigan and Georgia who were involved in the ‚Äúfake electors‚Äù plot, which puts the probe one step closer to Trump‚Äôs orbit. The Justice Department is asking witnesses about the role of Eastman and former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, according to The New York Times.\n\nFederal grand jury subpoenas have been issued to at least one figure who planned pro-Trump rallies in Washington, DC, on January 6. The organizer, Ali Alexander, says he is complying. Investigators‚Äô interest in Alexander show that they aren‚Äôt only looking at the rioters themselves.\n\nSeparately, the Justice Department has charged former Trump advisers Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro with contempt of Congress for defying committee subpoenas. (They maintain their innocence.) Prosecutors declined to charge Meadows and another top Trump White House aide, Dan Scavino, who claimed that executive privilege protected them from having to testify.\n\nIt‚Äôs unclear how far the Justice Department will go to investigate Trump. Attorney General Merrick Garland said he is ‚Äúcommitted to holding all January 6th perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law,‚Äù but many legal analysts have expressed skepticism that he‚Äôll go after Trump, based on the slowness of the probe and the challenges of charging a former President.", "authors": ["Marshall Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/06/08"}]}

Doug Mastriano, who has embraced Trump‚Äôs lies about the 2020 presidential election, against Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who has defended the state‚Äôs election procedures ‚Äì with the winner gaining the power to appoint the secretary of state who will take control of Pennsylvania‚Äôs election machinery in time for the 2024 presidential contest.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information Wednesday.", "authors": ["Brian Rokus Paul Leblanc", "Brian Rokus", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/06/08"}]}

If we do the same thing they do, our democracy will literally be in jeopardy.‚Äù\n\nKimmel pushed back a bit at this assertion saying, ‚Äúit‚Äôs like you‚Äôre playing Monopoly with somebody who won‚Äôt pass ‚ÄòGo‚Äô and won‚Äôt follow any of the rules.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHow do you ever make any progress if they‚Äôre not following the rules?‚Äù Kimmel asked.\n\nBiden then interjected.\n\n‚ÄúYou got to send them to jail,‚Äù he said, referencing the square in the board game.\n\nPresident Joe Biden Visits Jimmy Kimmel Live\n\nBiden and Kimmel also spoke about inflation, which Biden called ‚Äúthe bane of our existence.‚Äù The President mentioned that it‚Äôs mostly in food and gasoline.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what kills you because it‚Äôs a little billboard telling everyone how expensive everything is,‚Äù Kimmel said. ‚ÄúIf Donald Trump leaves one of those Sharpies over for you, you could maybe change the price on that, you know?‚Äù\n\nKimmel first announced Biden‚Äôs appearance via Twitter (TWTR) Sunday night, and the interview caused some commotion.\n\n‚ÄúLast night we announced that our President, Joe Biden, would be stopping by,‚Äù Kimmel said on Monday‚Äôs show. ‚ÄúHe will be here, which is nice, because it gives the gang at Fox News something to scream about all week.‚Äù\n\nKimmel then showed a clip of Fox Business host Dagen McDowell saying that the interview takes place in the ‚Äúland of insanity in which we all live.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh, I see. What I do is insane. You guys telling us we should arm P.E. teachers to protect kids. That makes sense,‚Äù he said.\n\nKimmel then used some late night language to make his point even further.\n\n‚ÄúTucker Carlson giving Vladmir Putin a reach around every other night, sane,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPresident on a late night talk show, insane. Got it.‚Äù\n\nKimmel‚Äôs evolution\n\nHaving Biden join Kimmel, in particular, may be a savvy move by the White House. Kimmel has used his platform to make emotional stands about issues core to progressives‚Äô values, including Obamacare and gun control.\n\nIt‚Äôs quite the evolution for Kimmel who started his career as the raunchy host of Comedy Central‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Man Show‚Äù before writing songs about ‚Äúf**king Ben Affleck‚Äù and reading Mean Tweets on the ABC late night show.\n\nBut Kimmel‚Äôs entry into the political world was not much of a choice for the comedian. Many of the issues that Kimmel has taken on are personal for him.\n\nKimmel passionately spoke about the health care debate following the birth of his son, Billy, who was born with a serious heart issue. As for gun reform, Kimmel broke down in tears after a mass shooting took place in Las Vegas, his hometown, in 2017.\n\nThe reason that Kimmel has been able to stand out as this late night voice of the people is because ‚ÄúKimmel simply sounds like a regular guy making reasonable points,‚Äù according to Bill Carter, a CNN analyst who has written multiple books about late-night TV.\n\n‚ÄúProbably more than any other current late-night host, Kimmel projects solid working-class and family values,‚Äù Carter said. ‚ÄúHe seems to most viewers a guy who could share a beer and slice of pizza with anybody.‚Äù\n\nCarter added that when Kimmel is on ‚Äúthe edge of emotional breakdown over his fears for his newborn son, or the massacre of innocent people in his hometown,‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt come across to most viewers as ‚ÄúHollywood activism.‚Äù Instead, ‚Äúit comes across as human activism,‚Äù he wrote.\n\nBiden‚Äôs new strategy\n\nAs for Biden, the reason for the appearance is clear: it helps humanize him to voters and get his message across to millions.\n\nBiden and his advisers have been frustrated in recent months as their attempts to get the President‚Äôs message to break through to voters have been less than successful. CNN reported last week that the White House is looking for more opportunities to show off Biden‚Äôs personality outside of the staid set-piece speeches that have mostly marked their public relations strategy in the initial stage of his presidency, giving him little opportunity for the unscripted moments that have become a core part of his political identity over his long career.\n\nThe Kimmel appearance is a chance for him to show off the retail politician traits he‚Äôs honed during his more than 50 years in politics ‚Äî traits he‚Äôs not often been able to use due to a lack of interaction with real voters driven first by the Covid-19 pandemic and then a series of crises that have kept him at the White House.\n\n‚Äì CNN‚Äôs Kyle Feldscher contributed to this report", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/06/08"}]}

Johnson was expected to win the vote, especially given that around 180 MPs are thought to be on the government payroll and thus directly connected to the Prime Minister ‚Äì among them ministers, parliamentary private secretaries and party vice chairs.\n\nBut while Johnson and his allies tried to spin the vote‚Äôs result as a ‚Äúconvincing‚Äù and ‚Äúdecisive‚Äù number, the final count of lawmakers who rebelled against him was far higher than his supporters expected.\n\nBefore the ballot, some analysts said that if the number of MPs voting against him exceeded 100, he‚Äôd be in serious trouble.\n\nDoes it mean he is safe?\n\nTechnically and for now, yes.\n\nUnder current Conservative Party rules, a leader who survives a confidence vote is safe from another such challenge for 12 months.

Alberto Pezzali/AP In photos: Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Prev Next\n\nWhat are the next big challenges?\n\nThe large rebellion by his lawmakers will leave Johnson‚Äôs reputation diminished. It could also damage his ability to push through legislation.\n\n‚ÄúThe number of rebels who voted to oust Johnson far exceeds the Conservative Party‚Äôs working majority of 75 seats in the House of Commons. If the rebels are determined, they could threaten to stall the government‚Äôs legislative agenda which would further weaken the Conservatives‚Äô standing in the polls and heap further pressure on Johnson,‚Äù Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg bank, wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThe Conservatives are also facing two difficult parliamentary by-elections in late June after two of their backbenchers were forced to resign amid their own scandals. Losses in those polls could heap more pressure on Johnson ahead of a national general election expected in 2024.\n\nWhat are Johnson‚Äôs options now?\n\nJudging by his comments so far, the Prime Minister will aim to continue to cling on. In a statement Tuesday morning, Downing Street said Johnson will gather his Cabinet on Tuesday and ‚Äúpledge to continue delivering on what matters to the British people.‚Äù\n\nJohnson won on Monday, but the fate of his predecessor Theresa May will still be fresh in his memory.\n\nMay also faced a no-confidence vote ‚Äì again, triggered by Conservative lawmakers. She survived that vote ‚Äì with a larger margin than Johnson ‚Äì but ultimately resigned a few months later. If it turns out Johnson‚Äôs standing has been damaged beyond repair, he might opt for a voluntary exit rather than face the humiliating demise that she endured, which ultimately led to Johnson becoming Prime Minister.\n\nA nuclear option, which Johnson on Monday said he had no interest in, would be to call a snap election. Johnson was keen to remind his lawmakers on Monday that it was he who led the party to its biggest electoral win in 40 years in 2019.\n\nWhat are the options for the opposition?\n\nLabour Party leader Keir Starmer predicted to LBC radio that Monday‚Äôs ballot would mark ‚Äúthe beginning of the end‚Äù of the Prime Minister‚Äôs political career ‚Äì no matter which way it went.\n\nFollowing the vote, Starmer said Johnson was ‚Äúutterly unfit for the great office that he holds‚Äù and accused Conservative lawmakers of ignoring the British public. ‚ÄúThe Conservative government now believes that breaking the law is no impediment to making the law,‚Äù he added.\n\nJohnson became the first UK premier in history to be found to have broken the law in office when he attended a gathering to celebrate his birthday in breach of Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nStarmer‚Äôs deputy, Angela Rayner, told the BBC on Tuesday that the opposition would ‚Äúconsider all options‚Äù when asked if the Labour Party was thinking about triggering another vote of confidence in Johnson, this time across the whole of Parliament.\n\nScotland‚Äôs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called Johnson an ‚Äúutterly lame duck‚Äù following the vote.\n\n‚ÄúThat result is surely the worst of all worlds for the Tories. But much more importantly: at a time of huge challenge, it saddles the UK with an utterly lame duck PM,‚Äù Sturgeon said in a tweet on Monday night.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasov√°"], "publish_date": "2022/06/07"}]}
