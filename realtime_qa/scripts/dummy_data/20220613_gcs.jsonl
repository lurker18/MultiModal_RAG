Price growth has slowed from the 8.1% reported in last year’s survey, but remains significantly above the trend in 2017-21.\n\nSingapore maintained its pole position as the world’s most expensive city for the ninth time in the last eleven years, tying with Zurich (Switzerland) and overtaking New York (US), which fell to third place this year.\n\nAlthough three US cities (New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco) are among the top ten, North American cities have, on average, slipped down our cost-of-living ranking.\n\nWestern Europe accounts for four of the top ten most expensive cities in our ranking, owing to sticky inflation in groceries and clothing along with appreciation of the region’s currencies.\n\nThe Russian cities of Moscow and St Petersburg experienced the biggest drop in the ranking as sanctions weakened the rouble.\n\nOf the ten categories in our price index, utility prices rose the most slowly over the past year, reflecting the waning impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Grocery prices, however, continue to rise strongly.\n\nThis year’s Worldwide Cost of Living survey found that, on average, prices had risen by 7.4% year on year in local-currency terms for over 200 commonly used goods and services. This marks a decline from the record 8.1% increase reported last year, but price growth remains significantly higher than the trend in 2017-21. Although this year’s survey covers 173 of the world’s major cities, the global average has been calculated by excluding Kyiv (which was not surveyed in 2022) and Caracas (which continues to face hyperinflation), as was the case last year.\n\nSingapore and Zurich were the most expensive cities in this year’s survey. Zurich moved up from sixth place to join Singapore at the top, bumping New York (which tied with Singapore for first place last year) down to third place. Zurich, which is back at the top after three years, moved up due to the strength of the Swiss franc, as well as high prices for groceries, household goods and recreation. Overall, our top ten this year consists of two Asian cities (Singapore and Hong Kong), four European cities (Zurich, Geneva, Paris and Copenhagen), three US cities (New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco) and Tel Aviv in Israel. Our survey was conducted before the start of the Israel-Hamas war, which has affected the exchange rates in Israel and may have made it harder to procure some goods in Tel Aviv, thereby affecting prices.\n\nGlobally, utility prices (household energy and water bills) witnessed the slowest inflation of the ten categories covered in our survey. This was the fastest-rising category in 2022 and the moderation suggests an easing of the energy price shocks caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Grocery, on the other hand, saw the fastest pace of price growth. Food inflation has been sticky across the world as many manufacturers and retailers have passed on higher costs to consumers and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events continues to keep supply-side risks elevated.\n\nA free summary report can be downloaded here.\n\nEIU’s Worldwide Cost of Living 2023 survey compares the prices of more than 200 goods and services in 173 major cities.\n\nBesides easing supply-side tensions, the hawkish monetary policy stance adopted by the US Federal Reserve has helped moderate inflation in the country by our calculations. Moreover, several foreign currencies have appreciated against the US dollar in 2023. Both these factors have led to the majority of the 22 US cities covered in our survey falling down the ranks. Even then three US cities (New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco) are among the top ten. In New York prices were up by 1.9%. Although some grocery items, such as eggs and beef, and recreational activities saw increases, prices remained subdued for others, including petrol and clothing.\n\nOn the other hand, cities in Latin America and western Europe have moved up. The Mexican cities of Santiago de Querétaro and Aguascalientes were the biggest movers up the ranking, with the peso proving to be one of the strongest emerging market currencies in 2023, on the back of interest-rate rises and strong inward investment. European cities, in general, have moved up the ranks amid sticky inflation as well as appreciation in the euro and other local currencies in the region. Asia continues to see relatively low price increases on average. Four Chinese cities (Nanjing, Wuxi, Dalian and Beijing) and two Japanese ones (Osaka and Tokyo) were among the biggest movers down the ranking this year.\n\n“The supply-side shocks that drove price increases in 2021-22 have reduced since China lifted its covid-19 restrictions in late 2022, while the spike in energy prices seen after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 has also eased. However, the cost-of-living crisis is hardly over and price levels remain much above historical trends. We expect inflation to continue to decelerate in 2024, as the lagged impact of interest-rate rises starts affecting economic activity, and in turn, consumer demand. But upside risks remain—further escalations of the Israel-Hamas war would drive up energy prices, while a greater than expected impact from El Niño would push up food prices even further.” Upasana Dutt, Head of Worldwide Cost of Living at EIU\n\nA free summary report can be downloaded here.", "authors": ["Lucia Garcia"], "publish_date": "2023/11/30"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_cities_for_expatriate_employees", "title": "List of most expensive cities for expatriate employees - Wikipedia"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/16/travel/city-most-expensive-expats-mercer-2024/index.html", "title": "Cost of living survey: The most expensive cities for expats in 2024 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUprooting your life and moving to a completely different city for work isn’t always an easy decision.\n\nThere are many factors to consider, with cost undoubtedly high on the list. But which international city is the most expensive in the world for expats to move to?\n\nHong Kong has once again taken the title of most costly city for overseas workers in the 2024 Mercer Cost of Living Survey, which was released Monday.\n\nThe Asian city, which also topped the annual list in 2022 and 2023, was closely followed by Singapore, in second place.\n\nMuch of the rest of the top 10 was taken up by Swiss cities, with Zurich, Geneva, Basel and Bern coming in third, fourth, fifth and sixth place respectively.\n\nRising housing costs\n\nNew York was ranked as the eighth most expensive city for international employees to move to on the 2024 Mercer Cost of Living Survey. Eloi_Omella/E+/Getty Images\n\nThe report examined 226 cities based on the comparative cost of over 200 items in each location, including transportation, food, clothing, household goods and entertainment.\n\nNew York was the highest US city, taking seventh place, while UK capital London, which was in 17th place last year, jumped to eighth place. Nassau, The Bahamas took ninth place, with Los Angeles rounding out the top 10.\n\nAccording to the report, expensive housing markets and increased costs for transportation, goods and services are among the reasons why the cost of living in the top ranking cities is particularly high.\n\n“The cost of housing is a major factor in the Cost of Living City Ranking,” reads the study, pointing out that employees who spend a significant slice of their income on rent or mortgages will have “less disposable income for other expenses.”\n\n“Between 2023 and 2024, there was a lot of volatility in this cost around the world, with housing rental prices varying significantly between cities.”\n\nAdditionally, “inflation and exchange-rate fluctuations” were noted to have directly impacted the “pay and savings” of international workers.\n\nAt 92, Toronto was ranked as the most expensive city in Canada for international employees, followed by Vancouver at 101.\n\nFinancial impacts\n\nMexico City jumped 46 places to number 33 on the list of most expensive cities for international employees to move to. fitopardo/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nWhile the top of the list changed little from the previous year’s rankings, there were some considerably big jumps further down.\n\nAmong them were Mexico’s Mexico City and Monterrey, with the former moving up 46 places to number 33, and the latter climbing 40 places to 115.\n\nThe study also noted that the cost of living in the US was “a significant issue” for 2024, with seven US cities appearing in the top 20.\n\n“As US-based companies continue to source talent globally, inflationary pressures may give some inbound foreign nationals pause to accept a position in some of the high-cost cities and metro areas in the US,” says Vince Cordova, partner and mobility advisory leader at Mercer US.\n\n“Therefore, we believe employers should be open about sharing the cost of living and net pay information with prospective staff so they can better understand the financial impacts of relocating to the US, and make a fully informed decision on whether or not to move ahead.”\n\nThe cities that ranked the lowest for living costs were Pakistan’s Islamabad and Nigeria’s Lagos and Abuja. However, this was said to be partly driven by “currency depreciations.”\n\nThe price of a dozen large eggs, a liter of olive oil and an espresso coffee at a popular café were among the 200 products taken into consideration when determining the rankings for the cost of living in each of the cities.\n\nAccording to the study, the price of olive oil was the most notable hike on average.\n\n“Cost-of-living challenges have had a significant impact on multinational organizations and their employees,” Yvonne Traber, Mercer’s global mobility leader, said in a statement.\n\n“It is important for organizations to stay informed about cost-of-living trends and inflation rates and seek input from employees on these issues to effectively manage their effects.”\n\n2024 cost of living city ranking\n\n1.

And big-city dwellers can really take a hit.\n\nAccording to the annual Worldwide Cost of Living Index that’s published by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the average cost of living rose by 7.4% this year. Grocery prices increased the fastest.\n\nAlthough this is slightly lower than the 8.1% jump the same survey recorded in 2022, the numbers remain significantly higher than “historic trends.”\n\nBut there is some good news. Utility prices, the fastest rising category in the 2022 survey, showed the least amount of inflation this time around.\n\nInflation predictions\n\nZurich, Switzerland (pictured) tied with Singapore as the world's most expensive city on the Worldwide Cost of Living Index from the Economist Intelligence Unit.

Maremagnum/Corbis Documentary RF/Getty Images\n\nThe city-state of Singapore and Switzerland’s Zurich were named as the most expensive cities in the world.\n\nThe rise of the latter, which jumped from sixth place on last year’s list, was attributed to the strength of the Swiss Franc along with the high prices of groceries, household goods and recreation. Singapore’s costly transport and clothing were also noted.\n\nAlthough New York tied with Singapore for first place last year, the popular US destination, where prices have increased by 1.9% according to the study, slipped to third, tying with Switzerland’s Geneva.\n\nHong Kong, the only other Asian destination in the top 10, was fifth, while Los Angeles was at No. 6, and Paris was named the seventh most expensive city in the world.\n\nIsrael’s Tel Aviv shares eighth place with Denmark’s Copenhagen. However, it’s worth noting that survey was conducted before the October outbreak of Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nFinally, San Francisco, one of three US cities in the top 10, came in 10th place.\n\nMovers and shakers\n\nHong Kong, the \"Pearl of the Orient,\" came in fifth on the list of the world's most expensive cities to live in. Chunyip Wong/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nFurther down the list, Russian cities Moscow and St. Petersburg saw some of the sharpest drops, falling 105 places to 142 and 74 places to 147 respectively in this year’s ranking. The value of the ruble has dropped considerably since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe survey said the slow post-pandemic recovery and “subdued consumer demand” were among the factors that led to Chinese cities such as Beijing, which ranked at 34 last year, dropping several places down the list.\n\nDamascus, Syria, remains the world’s cheapest city. Tehran, Iran, and Tripoli, Libya, are also near the bottom, ranking in 172nd and 171st place respectively.\n\nUtility, domestic help and tobacco costs were highest in US cities, while Western European cities were some of the most expensive when it came to recreation, transport and household goods.\n\nGroceries and alcohol were most costly in Asian cities, according to the survey.\n\nThe 2023 Worldwide Cost of Living surveyed 173 major cities, comparing more than 400 individual prices across 200 products and services. It excluded Venezuela’s Caracas, where prices have risen by 450% since 2022.\n\nThe world’s 10 most expensive cities for 2023\n\n1. Zurich and Singapore (tie)\n\n3. New York and Geneva (tie)\n\n5.

And even bigger questions remain unanswered, including what caused the contamination and whether U.S. regulators could have alleviated the current formula shortage by stepping in sooner. The plant shutdown exacerbated ongoing supply chain problems among U.S. formula makers.\n\nWHAT CAUSED THE SHUTDOWN?\n\nIn mid-February, Abbott announced it was recalling various lots of three powdered infant formulas from the plant, after federal officials began investigating rare bacterial infections in four babies who were fed formula. Two of the infants died. But it’s not certain the bacteria came from the plant; strains found at the plant didn’t match the two available samples from the babies.\n\nThe company halted production while Food and Drug Administration inspectors conducted a six-week investigation of the plant.\n\nA preliminary report released in March found traces of a bacteria — cronobacter— on several surfaces throughout the plant, though not in areas used to make the powder. Plant records showed Abbott had detected the bacteria eight times in its products or facility since 2019.\n\nInspectors also flagged other problems, including standing water on the floor and employees who didn’t properly sanitize their hands.\n\nWHAT IS CRONOBACTER?\n\nThe bacteria occurs naturally in soil, water and other parts of the environment. Infections with cronobacter are rare but can be fatal in babies. Almost all previous outbreaks in the U.S. have been linked to powdered baby formulas, which don’t undergo the same high temperatures used to kill germs in many other foods.\n\nSometimes the bacteria can get into powdered formula after its opened at home if a dirty scoop is used or it is mixed with water that’s contaminated with the germ, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCronobacter typically causes fever in infants and can sometimes lead to dangerous blood infections or swelling of the brain.\n\nThe four reported illnesses were in Minnesota, Ohio and Texas between September and January.\n\nWHAT ROLE DID ABBOTT’S FORMULA PLAY IN THE ILLNESSES?\n\nIt’s still not yet clear. The FDA hasn’t released a final ruling on the problems at the plant and whether they are linked to the infections.\n\n“There are many factors involved in this ongoing investigation and we’re just not in a position to make any definitive statement,” FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said Monday..\n\nFood safety experts say the case underscores the challenges of tracing foodborne illnesses.\n\nBecause there were only two samples collected from the four cases, “Right from the get-go we were limited in our ability,” to link the baby formula to the illnesses, said the FDA’s food director Susan Mayne. “We simply don’t have the evidence to demonstrate that causality.”\n\nAbbot says the lack of a strain match indicates “there is no evidence to link our formulas to these infant illnesses.”\n\nSHOULD THE FDA HAVE STEPPED IN SOONER?\n\nThe FDA is facing intense scrutiny about what steps it took — and didn’t — in the months before the recall.\n\nFDA inspectors visited the factory in late September for a routine inspection, around the time that the first bacterial infection was reported in Minnesota. Although inspectors uncovered several violations— including standing water and unsanitary conditions — they didn’t find any bacteria and let the plant stay open. It’s unclear if inspectors were even aware of the first reported illness.\n\nAfter three more cases were reported, the FDA returned to the plant in January and detected the bacteria.\n\nThe FDA mainly focuses on assuring the safety of the food supply, with extra regulations and standards on foods for babies and children. But former FDA officials say the agency is supposed to consider potential shortages that result from shutting down plants.\n\nIn previous cases, the FDA has worked with companies to shift production to other facilities or find alternative supplies.\n\nThe FDA is doing that now under a new policy that eases imports of baby formula from foreign manufacturers. But both the agency and the White House are facing questions on why that step wasn’t taken sooner.\n\n“We always believe we can do better in terms of the time frame,” Califf said.\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., reported last month that a whistleblower had contacted the FDA in October with allegations about unsafe conditions and practices at the plant, including falsifying plant records and failing to properly test formula for contamination. She said the FDA did not interview the whistleblower until late December. Califf is scheduled to answer questions from DeLauro and other lawmakers on Thursday.\n\nWHEN WILL THE PLANT RESTART PRODUCTION?\n\nBoth the FDA and Abbott say they are working as quickly as possible to restart manufacturing at the plant. But FDA officials say the onus is on Abbott to demonstrate its Michigan plant meets rigorous safety standards.\n\nFormer FDA officials say fixing the type of problems uncovered at Abbott’s plant takes time, and infant formula facilities receive more scrutiny than other food types. Companies need to exhaustively clean the facility and equipment, retrain staff, repeatedly test and document that there is no contamination.\n\nEven after the facility opens, Abbott says it will take eight-to-ten weeks before new products start shipping to stores. The company continues to produce baby formula at its other plants in the U.S. and overseas.\n\n___\n\nFollow Matthew Perrone on Twitter: @AP_FDAwriter\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

The agreement represents a first step toward resolving a problem that has sent parents scrambling from store to store to find sustenance for their infants. But questions remain about what precisely the FDA will require of Abbott and the Sturgis facility operations before reopening is approved. The company has previously said that once the FDA has signed off on the fixes, it will take two weeks to restart production and another six to eight weeks to get the product back on shelves.\n\nFDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf said on the “Today” show on Monday that he felt “very comfortable” that the Sturgis plant would reopen in two weeks and that the shortage would be resolved by the end of the year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Today’s action means that Abbott Nutrition has agreed to address certain issues that the agency identified at their infant formula production facility in Michigan. The public should rest assured that the agency will do everything possible to continue ensuring that infant and other specialty formulas produced by the company meet the FDA’s safety and quality standards,” Califf said in a statement late Monday.\n\n“This is a major step toward re-opening our Sturgis facility so we can ease the nationwide formula shortage,” said Robert Ford, chairman and chief executive of Abbott, who noted that the shortage was also exacerbated by a voluntary recall by the company of formula that had been possibly tainted by a bacteria that sickened two babies and killed two others. The FDA has not proven that the Sturgis plant was the source of the contamination, the company has said.\n\n“We know millions of parents and caregivers depend on us and we’re deeply sorry that our voluntary recall worsened the nationwide formula shortage. We will work hard to re-earn the trust that moms, dads and caregivers have placed in our formulas for more than 50 years,” Ford added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the FDA statement, a proposed consent decree between the FDA and Abbott Nutrition and three of its top executives was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The proposed consent decree must be approved by the court. “Abbott Nutrition will be required to retain an independent expert to review the Sturgis facility’s operations to ensure compliance with the law,” the statement said.\n\nThe consent decree “allows the company to get back in operation. Given what has happened so far, the FDA is going to scrutinize everything Abbott does. There will be inspectors there. They will want to see batches to determine that problems will not recur,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nA protracted shortage affects low-income Americans the most, since half of baby formula is purchased by recipients of a food assistance program benefiting poor mothers and young children. Many more months of a shortfall would disproportionately impact low-income families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The FDA is working closely with Abbott to bring the facility back online safely,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Monday afternoon. “That is the key here, safely.” She said the administration is also “moving as quickly as possible” to bring in more formula from overseas.\n\nOn a call Monday night, Susan Mayne, the director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the FDA, said the agency would approve new types of formula from foreign and domestic sources on a case-by-case basis. It is already in discussion with producers, she said, to explain what is needed in terms of a review of ingredients, testing results and inspection history. On Friday, the White House announced the possibility of invoking the Defense Production Act to produce baby formula amid the shortage. But supercharging production of formula is no easy feat.\n\nMost formulas are made from a mix of protein concentrate from cow’s milk, rice starch, corn syrup and oils. They are sold ready to drink and in powdered forms that must be reconstituted with water. Because the minimum amounts of fat, protein, calcium and a number of vitamins is so stringently regulated, as many babies get 100 percent of their nutrition from formula for the first six months of life, a limited number of manufacturers have the ability to produce it effectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout 90 percent of the infant formula supply in the United States is produced by four major companies: Abbott, Gerber, Mead Johnson and Perrigo Nutritionals. To make up for the Sturgis facility shortfall, Abbott has prioritized infant formula production at its other plant in Columbus, Ohio, converting other liquid manufacturing lines into making liquid Similac, and has brought in millions of cans of product from its Ireland production facility.\n\nPerrigo has stepped up production to ship 37 percent more formula in the past three months than during the same period last year, and Gerber is running formula factories at capacity to accelerate product availability to retailers and online. Still, grocery store shelves have dipped, retailers are rationing popular brands and parents have traveled miles to locate formula for their infants.\n\nMembers of Congress have expressed frustration with both Abbott and the FDA, with Republicans also singling out the broader Biden administration for criticism over the formula shortage. “Months ago, I called for the FDA to take action on this looming crisis, and the Biden administration failed to provide a timely, substantive response,” Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) said in a recent statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse Appropriations Committee Chair Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.) said she received a lengthy report from a former Abbott employee who registered a litany of complaints about conditions at the Sturgis plant with the FDA last October.", "authors": ["Laura Reiley"], "publish_date": "2022/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.lawsuit-information-center.com/similac-enfamil-formula-shortages.html", "title": "Similac and Enfamil Baby Formula Shortage | 2024 Update", "text": "Parents of new babies in many parts of the country had a hard time finding infant formulas such as Similac and Enfamil. The supply chain problems currently hampering the U.S. economy have created a very acute shortage of infant formula, resulting in empty shelves and understandably stressed and concerned parents. There are concerns in 2024 about the infant formula supply chain and the fact that just a few companies control the market.\n\nFORMULA SHORTAGE UPDATES\n\nAugust 6, 2024: The shortage is over; the concern is not.\n\nJuly 31, 2024: An NEC baby formula lawsuit led to a $495 million verdict.\n\nMay 15, 2024: Republicans are blaming the Biden administration for not acting more quickly on the baby formula shortage crisis.\n\nApril 15, 2024: Three parents filed a proposed class action representing consumers nationwide who bought Similac, Alimentum, and EleCare products from April 2021 onward. They claimed that Abbott’s failure to adhere to essential safety standards caused the shortage and that it was unjust for the company to benefit from the resulting price increases.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that by controlling a significant market share and being a key supplier for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, Abbott had a responsibility to maintain production levels or stabilize prices. Plaintiffs argued that unjust enrichment, price increases were unnecessary, and the formula industry’s profit margin rose by 2.6 percentage points.\n\nBut. let’s face it, that is a slight increase. The court rejected the class, finding that overall sales revenues during the relevant timeframe most likely significantly declined, too, so isolating profit margin is not the best way to look at it.\n\nThe court’s opinion also highlighted that similar duties have not been imposed on pharmaceutical companies during drug shortages. He dismissed the argument that Abbott’s case was different because it was responsible for the production stoppage and shortage, stating that if Abbott had any duty, it was to halt the release and distribution of the contaminated formula—a measure taken by closing the facility and recalling the products.\n\nA win here would have been nice, but most parents care more about safe formula than making a few bucks in a consumer class action lawsuit.\n\nMarch 15, 2024: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) conducted a study to investigate the long-term characteristics of the U.S. infant formula market that made it susceptible to these disruptions. The study aimed to provide insights for creating a more resilient supply chain in the future. The purpose? To ensure the debacle in 2022, when we faced significant disruptions in infant formula supply, adversely affecting millions of American families, does not repeat itself. These disruptions highlighted the critical nature of maintaining an uninterrupted supply chain for essential goods, including infant formula. Because a lot of children and families went through a lot\n\nThe FTC examined the effects of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) regulatory framework for infant formula. Both federal programs profoundly impact the market, balancing competition, consumer safety, and the well-being of vulnerable populations.\n\nThe FTC’s findings highlighted the role of WIC’s single-supplier contracts and FDA regulations in shaping the market dynamics. While these programs aim to support public health and safety, the study suggests that certain aspects may inadvertently contribute to market concentration and supply chain fragility. For instance, WIC’s approach of contracting with a single formula manufacturer in exchange for rebates has led to a high concentration of market power with a few manufacturers, making the supply chain vulnerable to disruptions. This, combined with regulatory barriers for new entrants, poses challenges to market competition and resiliency.\n\nFurthermore, the FTC report underscores the importance of competition-based reforms to enhance the supply chain’s robustness. It suggests reevaluating WIC’s single-supplier contract model and considering the competitive impact of FDA regulations to ensure a more diversified and resilient infant formula market.\n\nIn response to the formula shortages, the FTC supports exploring policy adjustments that could mitigate risks of future disruptions while balancing the essential objectives of consumer safety and accessibility. This includes examining the structural factors within the infant formula market and the roles of federal programs in contributing to these challenges. The report calls for a thoughtful analysis of potential trade-offs between competition, supply chain stability, and regulatory priorities to serve American families better and ensure safe, nutritious infant formula availability.\n\nMarch 14, 2024: This week, a $60 million verdict was entered in an NEC lawsuit in Illinois.\n\nJanuary 9, 2024: Reckitt/Mead Johnson Nutrition has voluntarily initiated a recall of select batches of Nutramigen Powder, a specialty infant formula designed for managing cow’s milk allergies. This decision comes amid concerns of potential bacterial contamination with Cronobacter sakazakii. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has clarified that all products in question underwent extensive testing by Reckitt/Mead Johnson and tested negative for the bacteria.\n\nThe affected products include Nutramigen Powder in 12.6 and 19.8 oz cans, manufactured in June 2023. These products were distributed primarily in June, July, and August 2023 through retail stores nationwide. The FDA has noted that it is likely most, if not all, of the recalled products in the United States have already been consumed.\n\nDecember 12, 2023: In 2023, cronobacter sakazakii, the bacterium responsible for last year’s powdered formula recalls, has reportedly been linked to two severe infant infections. One case in Kentucky resulted in a fatality, and another in Missouri led to brain damage in a 6-week-old infant. Although the infants consumed formula produced by Abbott Nutrition, the FDA has found no connection to the company’s manufacturing facilities and sees no current public health concern warranting further recalls. The situation underscores the need for heightened awareness and caution when handling powdered infant formula, particularly for vulnerable groups like premature babies.\n\nNovember 7, 2023: A cross-party group of lawmakers, including U.S Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Marco Rubio (R-FL), as well as U.S Representatives Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA-06), Stephanie Bice (R-OK-05), and Maria Salazar (R-FL-27), put forth a bill that spans both chambers of Congress. This proposed legislation aims to bolster federal backing and widen the availability of donated breast milk through nonprofit milk banks nationwide for parents and their medically vulnerable babies. The “Access to Donor Milk Act of 2023” would enable state agencies to allocate funds from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) towards raising awareness about the importance and demand for donor milk. Furthermore, it would permit using WIC funds to support activities related to donor milk in various states.\n\nNovember 1, 2023: According to a recent warning letter from the FDA, Similac Probiotic Tri-Blend infant formula may be unsafe for consumption. The letter warned Abbott Laboratories, the maker of Similac formula, that at least two ingredients in the formula product were potentially unsafe. The FDA also indicated that Abbott’s marketing materials for the product may violate agency regulations.\n\nJuly 1, 2023: The FDA announced that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) will independently inquire into the U.S. infant formula industry. This investigation will scrutinize current market conditions, manufacturing diversity, product types, production capacities, and domestic vs. imported formula volumes.\n\nThe study aims to understand the pre and post-COVID-19 market changes, including aspects like the Abbott recall incident in February 2022. It will also examine the influences affecting market competition and regulatory variations between the U.S. and foreign markets like the European Union. Once completed, NASEM will report its findings to Congress and the FDA.\n\nUnder the 2022 Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, the FDA was tasked with creating an immediate strategy for enhancing the resilience of the U.S. infant formula market, published in March 2023. Using insights from the NASEM study, the FDA will work on a long-term national strategy.\n\nMay 28, 2023: The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an investigation in 2022 to look into potential bid-rigging among baby formula manufacturers, including Abbott Laboratories, on state contracts. The probe centers around bids submitted to supply the Department of Agriculture’s Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, providing a free formula to low-income families. Winning these contracts is said to boost commercial sales. Furthermore, the FTC is scrutinizing the company’s formula sales outside the scope of the WIC program. This inquiry coincides with an ongoing contention between the FTC and Abbott over the disclosure of information following a nationwide formula shortage that resulted from Abbott’s closure of its Sturgis, Michigan, plant in February 2022.\n\nMarch 29, 2023: Former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) official Frank Yiannas has told House lawmakers that we must do more to prevent another baby formula shortage.\n\nLast year, Abbott Laboratories, the biggest maker of infant formula for the market, withdrew Similac following reports of illness and deaths. Parents across the country were left searching for supplies in the subsequent recall. Yiannas presented lawmakers with recommendations, including demanding higher standards from formula manufacturers.\n\nCongress is taking this seriously and looking for solutions.\n\nFebruary 18, 2023: The shortage has mostly ended, but the investigation of Abbott is just in the first inning.\n\nDecember 1, 2022: Shortages are expected to continue through the spring of 2023.\n\nOctober 1, 2022: U.S. regulators yesterday unveiled a new plan to prevent future baby formula shortages. The plan is a little scary. Foreign baby formula manufacturers will be permitted to continue to sell in the U.S. to allow for more sellers of baby formula.\n\nJuly 15, 2022: The in-stock statistics that many of us have become familiar with measure the expected demand that stores have available for sale, which was 72% for baby the week ending July 10, 2022. This is up 2% from the week before but still abysmal.\n\nJuly 1, 2022: The Sturgis plant for Abbott reopened again for the second time.\n\nJune 9, 2022: Danone SA said it will try to help the baby formula shortage in the United States. The French company says it has doubled production and is sending its specialized baby formula to the United States.\n\nJune 7, 2022: The baby formula shortage is not getting better. According to Datasembly, out-of-stock rates jumped to 74% in the U.S. for the week that ended May 28, up from 70% the previous week. This crisis will hopefully soon be over, but we are not there yet.\n\nJune 6, 2022: The White House announces the 5th operation of Operation Fly Formula. This sounds great. But families on the ground are not feeling the benefits.\n\nJune 4, 2022: Abbott says it is restarting production at the Michigan facility whose food poisoning outbreak was a significant factor in the baby formula shortage we have. But that formula will not reach consumers until June 20th at the earliest.\n\nMay 11, 2022: The baby formula shortage continues to get worse with inventories reportedly down at their lowest point. This week, a number of the nation’s top retailers, including Costco, CVS, Walgreens, and Target, have announced strict rules limiting the amount of formula that individual customers can purchase. The infant formula shortage has recently been made even worse in March when Abbott Laboratories was forced to recall Similac and EleCare formula products after a dangerous bacteria contamination was discovered at its facility in Sturgis, MI.\n\nThe Similac recall is not helping the formula shortage\n\nApril 8, 2022 update on the shortage\n\nMay 13, 2022 – house oversight committee is looking into the baby formula shortage\n\nEarlier this week, the Infant Nutrition Council of America issued a statement recognizing the baby formula shortage. The Council claims that government agencies and formula companies are working to ensure that infants have access to formula. This is little solace for parents battling to find baby formula for their children.\n\nInfant Formula Shortage Makes National Headlines\n\nThe infant formula shortage got national attention last week after CBS News issued a report spotlighting the acute lack of formula in many parts of the country. The CBS report noted that infant formula inventories were down 20% compared to pre-pandemic levels and that powdered formula was becoming extremely hard to find in many urban areas. The report of a Similac shortage was quickly picked up by the rest of the national media.\n\nAccording to the story, a couple in the San Francisco area with a 10-month-old went to nearly a dozen different stores and were not able to find Similac or Similac Pro Advance. After driving as far as an hour away to find liquid Similac, the couple was forced to switch to a different product for their son. A couple in the Orlando area reported a similar experience when searching for Enfamil for their 10-week-old son who was born prematurely.\n\nWhy Is There a Formula Shortage in 2022?\n\nFormula manufacturers such as Mead Johnson and Abbott Laboratories have acknowledged the issue. They claim that they are shipping products to stores as quickly as possible. Industry experts say that the shortage is the result of external factors that are interrelated.\n\nFirst, there is an acute shortage of many of the raw ingredients that are used to manufacture infant formulas (which are mostly derived from cow’s milk). These shortages are the result of systemic supply chain problems that have resulted from the COVID pandemic. The lack of raw ingredients has forced manufacturers to slow production.\n\nTo compound the formula shortage of 2022, the reduced volume of formula products that are being manufactured is taking longer to make its way onto store shelves. This is largely due to supply chain problems and labor shortages. The net result is that products such as Similac and Enfamil are not available at major retailers such as Walgreens, CVS, and Target. Online retailers such as Amazon are also short on supplies.\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nSimilac NEC Lawsuits\n\nEnfamil NEC Lawsuits\n\nNEC Formula Product Liability Cases\n\nExample of Recent Enfamil NEC Lawsuit\n\nShortages May Trigger Stockpiling and Price Inflation\n\nThe Similac and Enfamil shortage, which is a grave concern for infants who cannot breastfeed, has predictably started to prompt panic buying like what we saw with toilet paper and other items at the start of the pandemic. A spokesperson for INCA noted that they were seeing “some anecdotal evidence suggesting pantry-loading behaviors, which can put increased pressure on in-store inventory.”\n\nINCA is encouraging parents to only keep a 2-week supply on hand and “avoid unnecessary stockpiling” to ensure that all parents have access to the formula they need. But will likely have little impact on the individual choices of parents desperate to meet the nutritional needs of their new babies. There are emergency sources of infant formula. But it’s not clear how effective or efficient these are.\n\nThe increased attention now being given to the baby formula shortage will likely increase the already high level of demand for formula. The presence of intense demand in the face of lower supplies will almost invariably lead to some level of price inflation.\n\nHealth Risks of Enfamil and Similac Infant Formulas\n\nThe current supply shortages of major cow-milk infant formulas such as Enfamil and Similac come just as these formula products are coming under fire for posing serious health risks for premature babies. Recent research has determined that formulas made from cow’s milk are potentially dangerous for premature infants because they significantly increase their risk of developing a deadly intestinal infection called necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).\n\nNEC is a very aggressive infection that attacks the gastrointestinal systems of infants and can cause rapid tissue decay. If not immediately treated, NEC can lead to perforations in the walls of the intestines and lead to systemic infections that are frequently fatal for premature babies.\n\nOver the years, a growing body of scientific evidence of a causal link between NEC in premature infants fed with Similac, Enfamil, and other bovine formulas. Despite being aware of this evidence, the formula manufacturers have deliberately ignored this link, failed to warn about the risk of NEC for premature infants, and falsely marketed their products as safe for preemies.\n\nThis has prompted a wave of Similac NEC lawsuits and Enfamil NEC lawsuits by parents of preemies who were fed with these formulas at the hospital and subsequently developed NEC.\n\nFAQs: Similac Shortages\n\nWhen will formula shortages end? Formula shortages were at 31% in April, compared to 23% in January. However, major formula manufacturers like Abbott and Mead Johnson are trying to address the issue by rerouting supplies from other markets.\n\nIs there are shortage of Similac Pro Total Comfort? There is currently a shortage on almost all liquid baby formula products, including Similac Pro Total Comfort. This doesn’t mean this product will be unavailable. The shortages are very regional in nature.\n\nWhy is puramino out of stock everywhere? Enfamil Puramino may be out of stock in stores in your area because there is currently a nationwide shortage in baby formula supplies.\n\nContact Us About NEC Formula Lawsuits\n\nIf your premature baby was fed with formula and developed NEC you may be entitled to financial compensation.

Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images\n\nThe 2022 U.S. Women’s Open, the biggest women’s tournament of the year, kicks off this week at Pine Needles in North Carolina. Here’s everything you need to know to watch the tournament.\n\nHow to watch the U.S. Women’s Open\n\nThis year the best players in golf will compete for the U.S. Women’s Open crown at another classic American golf course. Designed by legendary architect Donald Ross, Pine Needles has previously hosted three Women’s Opens in 1996, 2001 and 2007.\n\nOne of the primary stories heading into the second major of the year is the return of American star Nelly Korda. Korda has been sidelined since March while recovering from a blood clot which forced her to miss the first major of the year, the Chevron Championship. Korda has never won the U.S. Women’s Open, though she captured her first major victory at last year’s KPMG Women’s PGA Championship.\n\nShe’ll face a stout field featuring the player who took over the No. 1 ranking from Korda, Jin Young Ko, world No. 3 Lydia Ko and rising star Jennifer Kupcho, who won her first major at the Chevron in March. Michelle Wie West will also be in the field in what she has said will be her last LPGA start for the foreseeable future.\n\nAnd there’s the money. Earlier this year, the USGA announced the U.S. Women’s Open purse would nearly double to $10 million in 2022, by far the largest purse in LPGA history, thanks to new presenting sponsor ProMedica. The winner will take a home a whopping $1.8 million.\n\nFortunately for golf fans, the biggest event of the year has the most extensive live coverage as well. NBC and USA will provide the TV coverage, and Peacock will be the streaming home for the U.S. Women’s Open, with some exclusive coverage during the first two rounds.\n\nSIGN UP FOR PEACOCK TO WATCH THE 2022 U.S. WOMEN’S OPEN, THEN ENJOY EVERYTHING THE PLATFORM PROVIDES\n\nYou can find out how to watch the 2022 U.S. Women’s Open below, including full TV and streaming schedules and tee times.\n\nU.S. Women’s Open basics\n\nWhat: 2022 U.S. Women’s Open presented by ProMedica\n\nWhere: Pine Needles Lodge and Golf Club, Southern Pines, N.C.\n\nWhen: Thursday-Sunday, June 2-5\n\nPurse: $10 ($1.8 million winner’s share)\n\nLast year’s champion: Yuka Saso\n\nHow to watch the 2022 U.S. Women’s Open on TV (ET)\n\nYou can watch television coverage of the 2022 U.S. Women’s Open on NBC and USA.

The conservation win comes as bumblebees have faced serious decline throughout the United States due to climate change.\n\nThe Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, one of several nonprofits petitioning California to protect the bees, celebrated the legal victory in a news release.\n\n“We are celebrating today’s decision that insects and other invertebrates are eligible for protection under CESA,” said Sarina Jepsen, the Xerces Society’s director of endangered species, in the release.\n\n“The Court’s decision allows California to protect some of its most endangered pollinators, a step which will contribute to the resilience of the state’s native ecosystems and farms.”", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://xerces.org/press/california-supreme-court-lets-decision-stand-that-bees-can-be-protected-by-california", "title": "California Supreme Court Lets Decision Stand that Bees Can Be ..."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-23/bumblebees-can-be-protected-as-fish-california-court-rules", "title": "Bumblebees can be protected as “fish” California court rules - Los ...", "text": "Close-up of a male Bombus crotchii, commonly called Crotch’s bumblebee. This species of bumblebee is named after the entomologist George Robert Crotch.\n\nIn a move that could allow a broad range of insects to be considered for endangered species status, the state Supreme Court has found that California bumblebees can be protected under the law as a type of fish.\n\nThe decision, which may carry deep consequences for the state’s agriculture industry, focuses on the arcane wording and complicated legal history of the California Endangered Species Act — a precursor to the federal law.\n\nThe court said late Wednesday that it would not hear arguments over whether the California Fish and Game Commission can consider granting protections to a number of bumblebee species whose populations are in steady decline. For the last three years, state almond growers, builders and pesticide companies had been arguing that bumblebees were exempt from listing because the state conservation law does not mention insects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn writing for the court, however, Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye said that even though the law does not use the word “insects,” sections of the law suggest that invertebrates may be grouped under the category of fish. She also suggested that the Legislature “is in a position to make whatever statutory amendments it may regard as necessary or useful” to clarify such ambiguities in the endangered species act.\n\nCantil-Sakauye also warned against misconstruing the decision as “an affirmative determination by this court that under the law, bumblebees are fish.”\n\nWednesday’s decision was quickly hailed by conservation groups.\n\n“We are elated with the California Supreme Court decision,” said Sarina Jepsen, endangered species director with the Xerxes Society for Invertebrate Conservation. “Now, some of California’s most endangered pollinators may be saved from extinction.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dispute arose after a coalition of conservation groups led by the Xerces Society, Defenders of Wildlife and the Center for Food Safety in 2018 submitted a petition to protect four species: the western, Franklin’s, Suckley’s cuckoo and Crotch’s bumblebees.\n\nThe California Fish and Game Commission voted to begin the listing process, but several agricultural and pesticide industry interests — including the Almond Alliance of California, the California Assn. of Pest Control Advisors and the California Building Industry Assn. — challenged its decision.\n\nThey worried that listing the four species would open the door to protections for any of the more than 1,000 species of native bumblebees in California, as well as countless other insects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe controversy does not involve scientifically cultured honeybees that California’s agricultural communities depend on to pollinate and produce a third of the nation’s vegetables and most of the world’s almonds.\n\nHowever, the agricultural industry has complained that some of the native bees considered for listing by the commission overlap with important agricultural areas where tilling, planting and harvesting activities could expose farmers and their workers to liability if protected bees are killed.\n\nFor example, the California Building Industry Assn., in court documents, suggested that the right to define terrestrial invertebrates as fish could “effectively make a criminal of anyone who has ever swatted a fly, run over an ant or eaten an aphid hidden in their broccoli without a ‘fishing license.’”\n\nIn Almond Alliance vs. California Fish and Game Commission, the groups complained that the endangered species act explicitly allows the government to designate native species of “bird, mammal, fish, amphibian, reptile or plant,” but excludes invertebrates such as bees.\n\nThe commission argued, however, that a separate section of the state fish and game code defines fish to include “wild fish, mollusk, crustacean, invertebrate, or amphibian.”\n\nA Superior Court trial sided with the industry groups.\n\nIn 2021, the Stanford Environmental Law Clinic intervened on behalf of the petitioners, who appealed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn May, the trial court ruling was reversed by a California 3rd District Court of Appeal opinion that found the state Legislature defined the term “fish” as “a wild fish, mollusk, crustacean, invertebrate, amphibian, or part, spawn, or ovum of any of those animals.”\n\nTherefore, the endangered species act’s definition of “fish” is a legal term of art that extends beyond the commonly understood meaning of “fish.”\n\nWhether the highly contested conservation law will ever be reopened for an overhaul by combative stakeholders remains to be seen. First passed in 1970, the California Endangered Species Act was repealed and replaced by an updated version in 1984 and amended in 1997.\n\nCalifornia Tidal marsh or ‘fake habitat’? California environmental project draws criticism California officials say a marsh restoration site provides key fish habitat. Critics say much of the land is too high above sea level to benefit fish.\n\nWord of the court’s decision set the world of native bee aficionados buzzing with rare, encouraging news.\n\nIt is a world that seems by its very nature to be pastoral and calm but which is honeycombed with problems, including climate change, competition from cultured honeybees, shrinking habitat and pesticides.\n\nOn a recent morning, as she awaited the Supreme Court decision, Krystle Hickman hovered over clumps of buckwheat in the western Mojave Desert, using a camera to document native bees.

According to people on social media, the court ruled that bees are fish.\n\nThat earned the ire of people who thought the court bumbled into its decision, like Donald Trump, Jr., who said that bees are fish “because words have no meaning.”\n\nTHE QUESTION\n\nDid a California court ruling classify bees as fish?\n\nTHE SOURCES\n\nTHE ANSWER\n\nYes, a California court ruling did classify bees as fish — in the context of a specific conservation law.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\n\nCalifornia’s Third District Court of Appeals ruled that bees are classified as fish under the state’s conservation law. The state had argued that because the law does not have a separate category for insects, bees fit into the legal definition of fish since they are invertebrates.\n\nCalifornia’s courts took up the question on whether bees are fish following a decision by the California Fish and Game Commission. The commission chose to consider four species of bumble bees for protection under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA).\n\nSeven California agricultural associations and one company argued the commission did not have authority to protect insects under CESA, and sued to block the decision. The agricultural associations said protecting bees under CESA would be disruptive to their industries because there would be ambiguity in whether certain farming behaviors would violate the bees’ protections.\n\nThe Sacramento County Superior Court issued a ruling in the case, called Almond Alliance v. California Fish and Game Commission, in favor of the agricultural associations. The commission appealed, and California's Third District Court of Appeal sided with the commission, saying the bees could be protected.\n\nWhen writing laws, legislators sometimes define words differently than their common, everyday usage. For example, U.S. Code defines “person” to include corporations and other companies.\n\nCESA defines “endangered species” to mean: “A native species or subspecies of a bird, mammal, fish, amphibian, reptile, or plant.” This same definition is used for “threatened species” and “candidate species,” the latter of which is the category the commission assigned to the bees.\n\nThe agricultural associations argued that because this definition doesn’t specifically include insects or invertebrates — invertebrates being animals without a backbone — the commission can’t list bees for protection.\n\nBut the commission argued that CESA relies on the state’s Fish and Game Code to define these groups of species. That code defines “fish” as, “a wild fish, mollusk, crustacean, invertebrate, amphibian.” Since bees are invertebrates, the commission has the authority to protect bees, it argued.\n\nThe Court of Appeals sided with the Commission.\n\n“Although the term fish is colloquially and commonly understood to refer to aquatic species, the term of art employed by the Legislature in the definition of fish in section 45 is not so limited,” it said. A “term of art” is a word or phrase that has a specific defined meaning in a certain context or field different to its commonly understood meaning.\n\nAlthough the first court acknowledged that the code included invertebrates in its definition for fish, it concluded that the California legislature specifically meant aquatic vertebrates. The appeals court disagreed.\n\nWhen CESA was passed in 1984, the appeals court said, the California legislature included protections for animals already protected under an older conservation law. Among those animals were two crustaceans and a mollusk, animals that aren’t included in the CESA definitions unless they’re included under the broader fish definition. The protected mollusk was a land-based snail, which the appeals court said is evidence that the “fish” definition extends beyond aquatic species.\n\nSince bees are invertebrates, that argument would mean bees are included in the state’s definition of fish used in its law to protect endangered species.\n\nThis decision does not change the definition of fish outside of the Commission’s authority to consider endangered species for protection.\n\n“We are celebrating today’s decision that insects and other invertebrates are eligible for protection under CESA,” Sarina Jepsen, director of endangered species for the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, which intervened in the case on behalf of the commission, said in a press release. “The Court’s decision allows California to protect some of its most endangered pollinators, a step which will contribute to the resilience of the state’s native ecosystems and farms.”\n\nThere is still a chance that the decision could be appealed further.\n\n“The decision could complicate ongoing efforts to manage farmland to protect wildlife and feed the nation and the world,” said Western Growers, one of the agricultural associations who sued the Commission to argue it can’t protect bees. “Western Growers and the agricultural coalition are carefully reviewing the decision and considering our options.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/08"}, {"url": "https://law.stanford.edu/2022/10/28/a-california-court-decision-bees-are-fish-shines-new-light-on-the-biodiversity-crisis/", "title": "A California Court Decision—Bees Are Fish—Shines New Light On ...", "text": "(Originally published by The American Bar Association on October 28, 2022)\n\nIn September, the California Supreme Court left in place a lower-court decision holding that bees are fish—at least for the purpose of protecting them under California’s endangered species law.

But this case, on which many of my students tirelessly worked, has stolen the spotlight. Celebrated in the environmental community, criticized by industry, dissected by legal scholars, and alternately lauded and ridiculed in social media posts, the decision that bumble bees and other terrestrial invertebrates may be listed as “threatened” or “endangered” under the California Endangered Species Act seems like a sea change in environmental law.\n\n(Continue reading the opinion essay on ABA’s page here.)", "authors": ["Stanford Law School"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}]}

(M).\n\nHudson’s Bay declined to comment on the report but allowed that it does “selectively evaluate opportunities.”\n\nNeiman Marcus, which also runs the 27-store discount “Last Call” chain and Bergdorf Goodman, said comparable sales fell 6.8% during the crucial holiday quarter, hurt by what it has called lower shopper loyalty and by a bungled tech systems migration that has wreaked havoc with its e-commerce. (Saks and Nordstrom (JAN) have also reported soft business in their full service department stores, but not to the same extent.)\n\nNeiman Marcus Group CEO Karen Katz, reading a script on a conference call but not taking questions from investors, re-iterated some of the problems that are decimating the retailer’s sales: shoppers have become far less loyal, in large part because of the ease of internet shopping and price comparisons, and want to buy items when they see them on a runway, rather than wait for months. The strong U.S. dollar is also pinching sales.\n\n“More and more, we’re seeing our customers shop multiple stores and web sites, not just ours,” Katz said.\n\nThe retailer withdrew its application to become listed on a public stock exchange in January, 17 months after first filing the paperwork, stoking concerns it would probably only fetch bargain basement prices for its shares. Neiman is owned by private-equity firm Ares Management and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, which paid about a high $6 billion price in 2013, when Neiman was far healthier.\n\nAnd Neiman is saddled with $5 billion in debt.

Before I dive into what this means for our mall, its important to note that J.C. Penney and J. Crew are filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It's unknown what Lord & Taylor will do. A company filing for Chapter 11 does not mean that the company suddenly ceases to exist and all locations immediately close. Instead, Chapter 11 Bankruptcy allows a company to continue operations while it works to restructure it's business in hopes that it can be saved or sold in order to return to profitability so they can repay their lenders. It's a complicated process that involves a bunch of lawyers in bankruptcy court, but filing for Chapter 11 does not necessary mean that the J.C. Penney, Lord & Taylor, and J.Crew are done-zo.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut let's not kid ourselves. The coronavirus pandemic is only accelerating retail trends that have been occurring ever since Jeff Bezos first started selling books out of his garage in 1994. The future of brick-and-mortar retail is bleak, and it becomes bleaker the longer this crisis goes on. Already teetering on life support, clothing and accessory retail sales just experienced a 89% drop in sales from this time last year. The New York Times ran a feature last month \" The Death of the Department Store ,\" which included the following quote from Mark. A. Cohen, the director of Retail Studies at Columbia University's Business School:\n\n\n\n\n\n“The department stores, which have been failing slowly for a very long time, really won’t get over (this crisis). The genre is toast, and looking at the other side of this, there are very few who are likely to survive.”\n\nIt's not just the rise of Amazon, but direct-to-consumer brands like Warby Parker, Bonobos, Everlane, AllBird, Parachute, Stitch Fix, Modcloth and countless others have also taken sales away from the stores you find in shopping centers across the country. Not to mention the big box stores like Costco, Walmart, and Target that have succeeded at the expense of traditional retail behemoths.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile many 1970 era enclosed malls in the country have failed over past decades, The Mall in Columbia has remained economically viable. Being located in one of the richest counties in America certainly hasn't hurt, but it's also done a tremendous job reinventing itself into an experience and entertainment destination while adding an outdoor pedestrian promenade and mixed-use retail and residential buildings to its perimeter. Before e-commerce, department stores had been the anchor that attracts people to shopping centers. Now, people go to shopping destinations for all the things you can't buy online: restaurants, eateries, entertainment venues, personal care services, healthcare, and fitness operations. Things that our mall has in spades.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce human ingenuity figures out a vaccine, treatment, or other solution that allows us to safely resume public gathering, The Mall in Columbia should continue to be a home for these type of amenity, dining, entertainment, and service-oriented businesses. It's the retail components that take up the majority of the mall's original footprint that I'm more concerned about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's presume this crisis spells the end of the Mall's J.C. Penney and Lord and Taylor (and what if Nordstrom and/or Macy's don't either), then the Mall in Columbia could suddenly have up to five gigantic anchor retail spaces sit empty. It would be a shame to have large areas of the Columbia's urban core go unused, especially when you consider all the wasted space taken up by parameter surface parking lots and garages adjacent to these department stores.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe obvious solution would be to seek out replacement tenants for these spaces. German discount grocery store Lidl is already set to takeover the lower level of the former Sears location that has been sitting empty for nearly 2 years. A warehouse club, Walmart, Target, or other big-box store willing to open at our mall are obvious replacements, but most of these businesses already have nearby locations. A large fitness center or medical facility would work, but I'm having trouble thinking about businesses that could successfully fill all these huge spaces, especially when you consider all the new competing retail spaces coming to downtown Columbia that may be more appealing to potential tenants.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther uses of abandoned department or big-box scores across the country have been food halls, innovation hubs, international centers, indoor BMV courses, homeless shelters, or religious centers. While we desperately need more school capacity in downtown Columbia , turning a windowless department store into a school or other municipal office use seems depressing.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet, this potential dead space could provide an opportunity. Knock down the unused parts of the mall and rebuild. If my prediction that suburban places with city amenities like Columbia become increasingly desirable in a post-Covid world , then we would be in need of more housing to ensure that living in downtown Columbia is attainable for all who want to live here. A decade ago, when the Downtown Columbia Master Plan was developed, restrictive parking covenants with the mall's department stores encumbered large areas where new mixed-use development would logically have been placed . So, instead of starting downtown development with all the surface park lots that surround the mall and developing from the inside-out, the redevelopment of downtown Columbia is happening from the the outside-in, starting with unencumbered land to the south (Merriweather District) and east (Lakefront) of the mall.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the Merriweather District and Lakefront development are complete and leased up, then the redevelopment of the parking areas and unused department store spaces at the mall would be the next logical step in further transforming our city's central core into a sustainable people-oriented urban center, especially if the physical, legal, and financial challenge presented by the department stores' leases were to be eliminated.\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.furnituretoday.com/department-stores-omnichannel/kohls-under-the-gun-again-to-put-itself-on-the-block/", "title": "Kohl's under the gun again to put itself on the block - Furniture Today", "text": "MENOMONEE FALLS, Wis. – It is a déjà vu moment as Kohl’s finds its under fire from activist investors pressuring the company to open itself up to acquisition offers.\n\nVision One Management Partners, which was founded in 2022 by Harper and former Carl Icahn “protégé” Courtney Mather, is seeking representation on Kohl’s board of directors and urging the company to put itself up for sale, according to Reuters and other business news outlets.\n\nThe retail company last found itself in exactly this spot in the early months of 2022, when a group of dissident investors pushed Kohl’s to accept takeover bids and attempted to oust the sitting directors along with company leadership.

The combined company will own 320 stores, including 179 full department stores. Hudson’s Bay edged out “a number of other Saks suitors,” including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Qatar Investment Authority. While many department stores have struggled, largely because of Internet competition, Saks “continues to benefit from luxury shoppers who, after closing their wallets during the recession, have come back in force since.” In 2012, its sales rose 4.4 percent, reaching $3.15 billion, and company executives said Saks had continued to rake in cash from foreign tourists.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The moment requires a step-change in strategy and support. Without such momentum, the country faces a democratic setback potentially as serious as the ones already occurring in India and Hungary (both now ranked only “partially free” by Freedom House) and the nearly one-hundred-year reversal that occurred following America’s Reconstruction era.\n\nMany Americans view this moment with concern, but their worry is measured: America’s system is creaky, but the world’s oldest democracy has strong institutions and will pull through.\n\nHowever, since the end of the Cold War, most democratic failure globally has been caused by elected governments using legal methods, such as gerrymandering and technical rule changes, to derail democracy. Their destructions of their own democracies have been supported by pluralities or majorities of their citizenries, whose polarization leads them to back policies that harm democracy to ensure their side prevails. America is on precisely this path.\n\nThe age and consolidation of U.S. democracy provides resilience—but Americans should not expect too much from the country’s historical strength. Many of the laws that form institutional guardrails were written poorly in the aftermath of the Civil War, with loopholes that are easily challenged given a lack of precedent. Moreover, the country’s age means that much of what are presumed to be laws and institutions are, in fact, simply norms. These norms are eroding quickly.\n\nOther organizations and philanthropists already understand the danger America is in. They are pouring time and money into getting more people to vote, particularly minorities and swing voters, to win back democracy. These efforts are necessary—but not sufficient. America’s democratic decline has accelerated despite record numbers of people, minorities, and swing voters voting. And for those on both sides of the aisle for whom these voting measures are proxies for partisan preferences they believe will save U.S. democracy, democratic decline in many states has accelerated despite Democratic control of both chambers of Congress and the presidency at the national level. The community supporting U.S. democracy needs a better strategy.\n\nThis paper has four parts\n\nThe Danger:\n\nInternational markers of American democracy’s swift decline\n\nThe playbook already underway at the state level to undermine democracy\n\nHow polarization is enabling antidemocratic action\n\nThe rise in political violence against key, targeted groups\n\nFive Strategies with concrete tactics to alter the current disintegration\n\nEnable responsible conservatives to vote for democracy\n\nReduce the social demand from the right for illiberal policies and politicians\n\nEngage the left in defending democracy by making it deliver\n\nBuild a broad-based, multistranded, prodemocracy movement around a positive vision concretized in locally rooted action\n\nStrengthen accountability to reset norms on what behavior is legal and acceptable\n\nInsufficient Tactics: activities that are crucial to hold democratic ground but that will not alter the trajectory\n\nHelp Democrats win\n\nIncrease voter turnout\n\nGet more minorities to vote\n\nCourt more swing voters\n\nImprove election administration\n\nIncrease economic redistribution\n\nFix gerrymandering\n\nThree Near-Term Futures:\n\nStable states run by one political party where voters cannot alter politics\n\nStates run by one political party whose control is upheld by violence\n\nA political stalemate with increased criminal and political violence\n\nAmerica is in a vicious cycle, and it is speeding up. Severe polarization is rapidly narrowing the available solution sets. The moment is serious and dire.\n\nYet it is not hopeless. During the 1890s in an era known as the Gilded Age, which was the last period of polarization as vast as today’s, America faced even greater troubles. Politicians were openly bribed, and legislation was bought. Company-controlled militias controlled their workers with tools such as an armor-plated vehicle mounted with machine guns known as the “death special” with legal support from the Supreme Court. Serious movements for communism and anarchism threatened the country’s democratic foundations. Anarchist bombings and the assassination of a president elevated political violence. Meanwhile, as historian Robert Mickey explained:\n\nLeaders of the eleven states of the Old Confederacy founded stable, one-party authoritarian enclaves under the “Democratic” banner. . . . These rulers curtailed electorates, harassed and repressed opposition parties, and created and regulated racially separate—and significantly unfree—civic spheres. State-sponsored violence enforced these elements.1\n\nWhat followed was not the death of democracy. Instead, many Americans with different interests brought about social and political reforms that revitalized the social contract and enabled the so-called American Century of the 1900s. Unfinished work from that set of democratic changes led to the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nWe must act now, at scale, with strategy.\n\nAs political scientist Lee Drutman has written, a nadir can also enable a change of direction.2 Today, Americans have a chance to not just piece together the cracked remnants of what was—but to create the next chapter of America. In fact, we not only can do better, but we must think bigger to galvanize the movement we need to succeed at our immediate challenges. We must act now, at scale, with strategy.\n\nThe Danger: America’s Democratic Decline\n\nU.S. Democracy Is in Swift Decline\n\nEvery major international measure of democracy demonstrates serious U.S. decline. The Varieties of Democracy index charts growing autocratization since 2010; the Economist Intelligence Unit downgraded the United States to a “flawed democracy” in 2017; Europe’s International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance now classifies the United States as a “backsliding democracy”; and Freedom House shows the United States on one of the fastest downward trajectories of any country, now ranking U.S. democratic quality alongside Romania and Croatia.3\n\nAmerica has long-standing democratic challenges that built slowly over the last twenty-plus years. The country’s politics have fundamentally altered, and many Americans who came of age in previous decades are not aware of just how great the change has been.4 The terms “swing” and “battleground” states did not exist before the 1990s, because so many states were competitive. Now, just a handful are at play in presidential races, raising the stakes in those places while effectively disenfranchising many voters elsewhere whose contra-majority votes in safe constituencies are known not to matter well in advance. This year’s redistricting further increased the number of so-called safe seats, which now compose about 90 percent of the House of Representatives. Such a large number of safe seats pushes candidates to cater to the views of extreme partisans rather than tacking to one side during primary elections and then back to the middle for their general elections. The procedural tool known as the filibuster (which requires sixty votes to override, allowing a minority of senators to stop legislation even if a majority support it) was altered in the 1970s in a way that made it easier to use. Yet it has only been routinely employed since 2010. It has made rule by the majority into rule by the supermajority, creating gridlock, incentivizing further gerrymandering, and frustrating Americans who feel that even voting for a party that wins the majority does not advance their policy goals.\n\nThese slow-growing phenomena opened the door to today’s acute problems. Antidemocratic politicians supported by safe seats and polarization have walked through and begun enacting an authoritarian playbook. This playbook has massively accelerated democratic disintegration over the last five years. Like the American author Ernest Hemingway’s famous quip about how one goes bankrupt, America has been losing its democracy at first gradually, and then suddenly.\n\nThe left has contributed its share to this slippage. In the strategies section, I suggest tactics to reverse the alienating politics of the left that are deepening polarization, static identities, and competitive victimhood and driving many Americans toward extremism. However, the rapid decline is asymmetric. It is primarily being driven by a very different Republican Party.\n\nOf the Republicans in Congress on the day former president Donald Trump took office, half are now gone. Since the Republicans’ Tea Party revolution, a supposedly populist upsurge partially engineered from the top in 2008 to alter the power structure in the party, approximately 75 percent of Republican House and Senate seats have changed hands.5 The Republicans leaving are those who—like former congressmen Jeff Flake, Peter Meijer, and Rob Portman—have been more bipartisan or willing to stand for democratic norms. Those elected after 2008 include Representatives Lauren Boebert, Madison Cawthorn, and Marjorie Taylor Greene. Among those known to have asked Trump for preemptive pardons for their role in the insurrection, nearly all were elected after 2008.6 The extremist wing of the Republican Party is a recent phenomenon whose nationwide reach and depth within states is already extensive. A report by the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights (an organization that has for a long time been tracking white nationalism and anti-Semitism) found that 21 percent of Republican state legislators had joined extremist social media groups.7 Trump is an accelerant of this trend, but his absence alone will not undo the damage.\n\nThe Republican Party is no longer the party of former president Ronald Reagan, nor is it even the party of long-serving conservatives like Representative Liz Cheney. A paper classifying over 1,000 political parties across 163 countries by ideology and tactics finds that the current Republican Party looks far closer to authoritarian populist parties—like Fidesz–Hungarian Civic Alliance in Hungary and the Justice and Development Party in Turkey—than to mainstream conservative parties such as Germany’s Christian Democratic Union or Canada’s Conservative Party.8\n\nThat is because leaders of this new Republican faction are not only further right but are also far less committed to democratic institutions, practices, and norms.9 They are aware that in increasingly safe seats, their main threat is from a primary challenger.10 A base whose majority is White, evangelical, rural men, and which in 2016 gained a larger percentage of formerly swing voters who cared about identity issues but wanted more government economic redistribution, is more easily motivated by identity than by traditional conservative policy issues such as small government or low taxes.11 These politicians have also come of political age seeing that bipartisanship can enable hit ads that hurt their chances in primaries but that violence and voting manipulation will not be punished at the ballot box.12\n\nA Corrosive Playbook Is Already Underway\n\nThe democracy community needs speed and strategy at scale, because antidemocratic activity at the state level is already well underway. It is following a playbook pioneered by democracies that have been destroyed recently in other countries as well as in the United States’ own past authoritarian enclaves.13\n\nLegal changes to alter who can vote, which votes count, and who adjudicates. In Hungary, the Fidesz party used autocratic legalism to legally alter laws with the support of voters until the playing field for democracy was irrevocably tilted in a way that created supermajorities for one party.14 Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who was elected to a fourth term in 2022 despite the country’s remaining six opposition parties backing a single candidate, shows how effective such legal manipulations can be.\n\nIn America, many states have been flooded with laws to alter voting. The worst of these maneuvers have occurred in a dozen states that have passed laws transferring power to more partisan electoral bodies and/or criminalizing their election administrations. These antidemocratic legal moves cannot be overcome by turnout.\n\nFor example, in Texas, poll watchers must be granted access to any part of a polling location. Texas has also criminalized any action by an election worker to restrain poll watchers.15 Texas also has an open carry gun law with no permit requirement. So, if poll watchers walked into a polling location with assault rifles in Texas, their actions may run afoul of federal intimidation legislation but appear to be in keeping with state legislation. A judge would have to adjudicate. Meanwhile, the law preventing election officials from intervening means that at best they can call law enforcement, whose presence can also have intimidating effects at polls.\n\nAt the same time, protective laws are failing. Michigan’s secretary of state tried to pass what is known as a time-and-place ban, which would have restricted the open carrying of guns into or within 100 feet of polling stations during the state’s early voting and election period in 2020. A judge blocked the effort.16 That ruling opened the door for what followed when Michigan gubernatorial candidate Ryan Kelley (whom the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] would later arrest for egging on the crowd at the U.S. Capitol on January 6) and state senate candidate Mike Detmer met with poll workers in Michigan.17 Kelley suggested that those worried about fraud should unplug tabulation machines, while Detmer reportedly advised poll workers to “be prepared to lock and load. So, if you ask what we can do, show up armed.”\n\nMeanwhile, an obscure legal tactic could allow state legislatures to legally select their own slates of electors (whose votes are those that actually count to determine the winner of the presidency), regardless of the will of their voters. The “independent state legislature” theory argues that the Constitution gives state legislatures alone the final determination of election procedures, superseding state constitutions, courts, governors, and even voters, whose votes for electors are only advisory.18 This once-fringe theory sounds far-fetched, but the Supreme Court has taken a case that will allow it to decide on the theory in June 2023, and four of the sitting Supreme Court justices have previously indicated their potential support in decisions from Bush v. Gore (2000) to spring 2022. While Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett has remained silent, the activism of this Supreme Court does not encourage confidence.19\n\nA coordinated campaign with bureaucratic, electoral, and violent components is attempting to replace competent, long-standing election officials of both parties with partisan activists.\n\nThe democracy community should stop conflating these dire changes with measures that require voter identification or reduce mail-in ballot access. I address such laws in the “necessary but insufficient” section, because their results are mixed.20\n\nPersonnel changes to ensure extreme partisans adjudicate election decisions. The key Republican in Wayne County, Michigan, who certified Detroit’s election and thus allowed the state’s votes to be counted, has since been replaced with a fierce election denier.21 Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, who refused to look for the 11,000 votes that Trump asked him to find, has faced death threats, harassment, and a Trump-supported primary challenger (though he ultimately kept his seat).22 A coordinated campaign with bureaucratic, electoral, and violent components is attempting to replace competent, long-standing election officials of both parties with partisan activists.\n\nThreats of violence against election workers, once nearly nonexistent, are now frequent—the Department of Justice (DOJ) has tracked over a thousand threats against election officials since the 2020 elections.23 In Colorado, threats are severe enough that some election officials are undertaking active shooter trainings and have been told to drive home following different daily routes to maintain their safety.24 A 2022 Brennan Center poll found that one in six election officials had experienced threats, and half had not reported them.25 About 50 percent had been threatened in person—not just online or on the phone. One in three knew at least one official who had already quit because of fear or threats.\n\nThe criminalization of routine electoral work is also part of a campaign to force out existing election workers and replace them with partisan activists. Laws are already being used in Arizona, Wisconsin, and elsewhere, forcing bureaucrats and bipartisan election boards to retain legal counsel to avoid jail for normal election decisions. For instance, in Arizona, new, contradictory laws forced the secretary of state to face criminal charges if she updated state election machines with the new maps. But these updates were also required by statute, following census-required redistricting. After updating them as required, she must now deal with the fear of jail time as a result. Many election workers are deciding that keeping their jobs is not worth these potential consequences.\n\nAmerica has the most decentralized elections in the world, and to run fair elections, local officials must master highly localized information and bureaucratic arcana. The median election official has worked in that role for twelve years; in large districts, most have served fifteen or twenty years. Fears of criminal, legal, or violent repercussions are creating an exodus of mid-level professional staff—the level of resignations since 2020 is unprecedented.\n\nStop the Steal activists—who wrongfully maintain that Trump won the 2020 U.S. presidential election—are being courted to replace them. Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon’s podcast devotes an extra hour of programming each day to highlight the local officials he is recruiting to run for office.26 The United States has over 3,000 counties: an investigation of just sixty-five of them found 8,500 new Republican precinct officers, with no similar Democratic surge.27 These new officials are managing everything from voter registration to cybersecurity.\n\nIn addition to taking over professional staffing, election deniers are running for the top elected positions that manage state voting procedures. In Colorado, an election denier in charge of Mesa County’s elections enabled voting machine passwords to be posted to public, online QAnon chat rooms.28 While she was indicted on ten counts by a Republican prosecutor, she is now running for secretary of state—a position that determines election rules. In fact, as of June 2022, two-thirds of those vying to be secretaries of state claimed that the 2020 election was fraudulent. More than one hundred election deniers have won their primary campaigns in 2022; nine states, including Michigan and Arizona, have election-denying candidates running for all major executive offices: governor, attorney general, and secretary of state.29\n\nThis media echo chamber does not need to create a solid story that can be confirmed or denied. Instead, it is selling doubt.\n\nDeepening doubt in elections as free and fair expressions of voter desires. Finally, just as Russian President Vladimir Putin has convinced many Russians that they are ridding Ukraine of Nazis, in the United States disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation on right-wing television and talk radio has succeeded in creating an alternate reality that facts cannot dislodge. This media echo chamber does not need to create a solid story that can be confirmed or denied. Instead, it is selling doubt. Voters who aren’t sure that a particular form of wrongdoing happened, but simply feel that something is not right, are actually harder to persuade with facts. Thus, while in October 2020 solid majorities of Republicans believed elections were fair, months of conspiracy theory coverage by mainstream-right outlets means that now, only 35 percent trust the election system and nearly three-fourths believe the current president occupies the White House illegally.30\n\nThese conspiracies build on one another. If you do not believe that COVID-19 is a serious disease, then altering election rules to make it easier to vote by mail in 2020 appears suspect. If you are concerned about an elite ring of pedophiles, then Democratic politicians requiring every American to wear a mask in public and establishing unprecedented lockdowns, which were widely reported to accelerate child abuse, appear pernicious. The building of conspiracy upon conspiracy—well-understood in psychological literature—makes unraveling each more difficult.31\n\nPolarization Creates Vicious Cycles That Accelerate Disintegration\n\nMuch of the authoritarian playbook is unknown to voters. Polarization has allowed this authoritarianism into U.S. politics and enabled the sudden, rapid decline of U.S. democracy.\n\nPolarization is based in some misbeliefs about the other side—which are greater among educated, media-consuming partisans on both sides and highest on the left.32 It is exacerbated by misinformation and disinformation. But it is also grounded in justified fears of the other side’s social and policy agendas. The extreme level of U.S. polarization means that when the left describes its concerns about growing authoritarianism, the right has its own examples to list in return.\n\nCoronavirus-related mask mandates, lockdowns, and forced business and school closures mean that people on the right not only fear authoritarianism in the social and economic spheres but have had concrete, daily experiences with what many feel to be the curtailment of their democratic rights. The feeling that their fears of democratic loss have been dismissed by the left make it hard for the average conservative to take the left’s concerns seriously. For instance, many felt a double standard when their economic, social, or mental health concerns about pandemic bans on public gatherings were ridiculed, while mass gatherings for Black Lives Matter protests were lauded. And while political violence and spontaneous hate crimes that harm people are being committed vastly more by those on the right and the overwhelming majority of Black Lives Matter protests were peaceful, the property damage from the few protests that were not resulted in over $2 billion in insurance payouts across twenty states, by far the most costly civil disturbance in modern U.S. history.33 The failure of the left to take such property losses and their personal costs—particularly to small business owners—seriously, and the conflation of these concerns with racism, galls many on the right.\n\nMeanwhile, instances of mass shootings, school shootings, the sending of child services to the homes of parents of LGBTQ children, and the rollback of legal abortion even in some cases of rape, incest, and the health of the mother are handing people on the left daily, concrete losses of rights in an equally personal and visceral manner.\n\nAs policy agendas have become more extreme with less overlap over the last twenty years, partisans fear the other side so much that voters are willing to allow antidemocratic action by their side to keep the other out of power. By February 2021, 72 percent of each party was claiming the other was “a serious threat to the United States and its people.”34\n\nScholars Milan Svolik and Matthew Graham have found that 85 to 90 percent of U.S. citizens would vote for their party even if it engaged in undemocratic action, rather than cross party lines.35 Numbers are far worse in states where voters have actually had to make such choices. A recent Bright Line Watch survey found that 28 percent of Democrats and 39 percent of Republicans favored “doing everything possible to prevent the other party from governing effectively”—numbers that reduced only slightly when misbeliefs about the other party were corrected.36\n\nLooking at cases of severe polarization globally since 1950, researchers Jennifer McCoy, Murat Somer, and Benjamin Press found that no other established democracy has been this polarized for as long as the United States. In McCoy’s and Press’s words,\n\nThere are no peer analogues for the United States’ current political divisions—and the track record of all democracies does not provide much consolation.”37\n\nThe lack of consolation is because among less-established democracies that faced pernicious polarization, the majority experienced democratic degradation. Of the twenty-six countries that degraded, twenty-three descended fully into authoritarianism. Of the minority of cases that did not degrade, all but nine repolarized in ensuing years.\n\nPolarization is allowing authoritarianism to take hold with voter support.\n\nGlobally, the world is in the sixteenth year of democratic recession. Democracies have primarily been dying at the hands of their own voters, who appreciate democracy but fear the other party so much that they will allow antidemocratic action to keep their side in power.\n\nThis is what is happening in America. Polarization is allowing authoritarianism to take hold with voter support.\n\nViolence Is Rising and Builds on Itself\n\nIn the face of ginned-up beliefs that their democracy is under threat and emboldened by the feeling that some police and politicians will excuse their actions, right-wing violence is skyrocketing, as data that I expanded from the Global Terrorism Database show (see figure 1).\n\nBox 1: Methodology The “far left” category includes attacks by groups identified with the far left, such as anarchists, and attacks that are partisan or support left-related policies such as economic redistribution. It includes attacks against law enforcement motivated by racial or left-associated concerns. Environmental terrorism includes animal rights and was large enough to merit a separate category, but it may be viewed as related to the far left. The “far right” category includes attacks by groups identified with the far right, such as militias, QAnon, and white supremacists, and attacks that are partisan or support policies associated with the American right, such as anti-gun control. Anti-abortion attacks were large enough to merit their own category but may be seen as related to the far-right. Anti-inclusivity includes hate-related terrorism against religious, ethnic, and racial minorities that cannot be attributed to any organizational affiliation. The single-issue category includes incel attacks, terrorism related to nonpartisan conspiracy theories, personally motivated attacks, and other small categories not clearly associated with the right or left in the United States. International/Hirabist includes attacks by individuals who associate themselves with al-Qaeda, the self-proclaimed Islamic State, and similar causes. The unclear/unknown category includes terrorism where the perpetrator is unknown or the motivation is unclear. It is largely composed of bombings of White-majority Protestant, Catholic, and other churches whose perpetrators are unknown and of activities of disturbed individuals that do not appear to be influenced by a political ideology. These categories have been developed and coded by the author from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) data set. The GTD’s event-based data set uses a definition of terrorism that does not include state violence or violence carried out as part of a law enforcement operation. It also does not include spontaneous clashes erupting at protests or riots or more spontaneous violent hate crimes. The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) data set does include ideological violence at protests and riots, but it cannot demonstrate trends because it only began tracking U.S. data in 2020. However, the relative volume of left- and right-wing violence within ACLED’s existing data is similar to the GTD data set.\n\nIn the fall of 2021, a University of Chicago study found that nearly 10 percent of Americans agreed that “force is justified to restore [Trump] to the presidency.”38 A separate, 22,900-person poll found that almost one in five Republican men claimed that violence was justifiable “right now.”39 FBI-reported hate crimes are at their highest level since the backlash against perceived Muslims that followed the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. White supremacist propaganda has risen nearly twelvefold since 2017, and supremacists are holding more than three times as many public events.40\n\nViolent desires are also growing on the left. Attacks are up slightly according to data from the Global Terrorism Database, particularly against law enforcement and visible Trump supporters. A survey by Nathan Kalmoe and Lilliana Mason from February 2021 found that 11 percent of Democratic respondents justified assassinating politicians of the other party.41 A survey of over 8,000 people from July 2022 found that of the respondents who justified political violence, 36 percent supported violence in defense of ethnic or racial minorities. Meanwhile, threats against members of Congress from both sides of the aisle are more than ten times as high as they were just five years ago: the number of threats investigated by Capitol Police leapt from 902 in 2016 to 3,939 in the first year of the Trump presidency and reached 5,206 by 2018; 8,613 in 2020; and 9,625 in 2022.42\n\nApart from the vastly disproportionate number of incidents, there is another crucial difference between left- and right-wing violence from a democracy standpoint.\n\nOn the left, those who justify violence identify least strongly with the Democratic Party—suggesting a disaffected fringe over whom the Democratic Party lacks control.43\n\nOn the right, those who show the greatest support for violence also most strongly identify with the Republican Party.44 That allows their violence to be used for political goals. Postelection violence and intimidation on the right began to align with the political calendar in 2016 and 2018. By 2020, violence and armed demonstrations were highly connected to key dates of election procedures.45 Right-wing violence and intimidation, in other words, is targeted.\n\nFor that reason, many people don’t feel this increase in violence. They see the January 6 insurrection as an isolated event. But it is not. On the right, violence, threats, and intimidation are being directed politically and are used for three goals.\n\nTo intimidate prodemocracy Republican politicians and thought leaders, causing them to resign or silence themselves, creating a single Trumpist-Republican-conservative identity.\n\n\n\nViolent tactics are being used against Republicans who show democratic backbone to eliminate the option of being a prodemocratic, conservative Republican or a Republican who engages in bipartisanship. Representative Adam Gonzalez, one of the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after January 6, is not running for reelection after constant harassment and threats of violence against him, his wife, and their young children. Immediately after his announcement, Trump issued the statement “1 down, 9 to go!”46 Of the ten Republicans who voted for Trump’s impeachment, four are retiring—two of them have admitted that death threats played a role in their departure.47 In fact, nearly every Republican national or state decisionmaker who supported fair elections in 2020 has been targeted with threats and violence, often with militia participation.\n\n\n\nAfter Marjorie Taylor Greene doxed colleagues who voted for U.S. President Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill, a number admitted to receiving death threats. Retiring Republican Representative Frank Upton, who voted for Trump’s impeachment and also for Biden’s infrastructure bill, admitted that the death threats, particularly against his spouse and family, were frightening and would affect other representatives’ willingness to vote for measures sponsored by the other party to create bipartisan legislation.48 Parents may be particularly at risk for intimidation out of public service. Al Schmidt, a Republican election board member in Philadelphia, resigned after being singled out by Trump and targeted with threats so significant that his children were given Philadelphia police protection.49\n\n\n\nViolent groups are also being used to overturn the leadership of local Republican parties. In Nevada, the right-wing, European chauvinist organization known as the Proud Boys took part in key votes in Clark County (the seat of Las Vegas and by far the largest county in the state) to sideline prodemocratic Republicans and empower a more Trump-aligned faction, allegedly at the behest of state Republican leadership.50 Local leaders scheduled meetings in schools precisely because they were gun-free zones, and they canceled other gatherings in an attempt to avoid being threatened out of office. Proud Boys have also joined the leadership of Florida’s Miami-Dade County Republican Party, turning meetings into intimidating shouting fests that are driving traditional conservatives away.51\n\n\n\nAnother target are opinion leaders. By offering a way to be conservative and prodemocratic, they pose a grave threat to the antidemocratic faction. Many respected conservative media personalities, such as the evangelical journalist David French, have received death threats and threats against their families, deterring others in the conservative establishment from following their lead and speaking up for democracy.52 Violence is a means to silence free speech. By reducing the marketplace of ideas to a binary—either antidemocratic Republicans or Democrats—violence also abets polarization. To eliminate officials who stand in the way of stealing a future election.\n\n\n\nAs already described, similar tactics are being used against elected officials and administrative election officials alike, from both parties, who could impede efforts to alter rules or procedures that would enable the theft of a future election. Secretaries of state such as Jocelyn Benson of Michigan, Katie Hobbs of Arizona, Jena Griswold of Colorado, and Maggie Toulouse Oliver of New Mexico have been targeted at their homes. Some had to relocate throughout the election season. Mid-level staff and temporary election workers have also been targeted.53\n\n\n\nRepublican state and county officials who have stood up for democracy and the fairness of their elections, such as Bill Gates in Maricopa County, Arizona, fall into the first category as well as this one and thus are targeted for both reasons.54 To solidify the base by appealing to a shared identity and identifying perceived enemies to unite against.\n\n\n\nThe use of dehumanizing language and increasingly violent imagery against women, minorities, and Democrats unites base voters whose grievances knit them together but who do not always share the policy beliefs of traditional conservative constituencies.\n\n\n\nThis dehumanization may entail accusations that Democratic politicians, school board members, and community leaders are “groomers” for pedophilia, as well as vile racial epithets, violent misogynistic imagery, and jokes using similar dehumanizing tropes. All these strategies lead more aggressive supporters to threaten, dox, and sometimes use actual violence against Democrats; racial, ethnic, and religious minorities; and women.\n\n\n\nThese forms of violence are the result of an attempt to create unity and intensity among base voters. Thus, they are the most widespread form of violence and threats, reaching everyone from school board members and public health officials to mayors and members of Congress. Threats are proliferating at the local level where municipalities have fewer resources to protect officials: a 2019 study found that 13 percent of mayors had been subject to physical violence—and that survey was taken prior to the uptick in threats in 2020.55 Extremist groups, such as the Proud Boys, are piggybacking on mainstream right-wing targets, causing health departments, school boards, and other institutions to face even greater violence and threats.\n\n\n\nWomen are three times more likely to be targeted, minority women even more so. Democratic female politicians received ten times as many intimidating and abusive messages as their male colleagues, with minority women the most targeted.56 But it also affects everyday women, minorities, and immigrants through increased hate crimes and mass shootings. While this form of violence is more about unifying the base than harming the target, it creates an atmosphere that abets efforts to target particular members of these denigrated communities who fall into the first or second categories—such as Black female poll workers.\n\nOn the left, violence looks more like what occurred in the 1960s and 1970s: it is coming from those outside the system, fringe individuals and groups fighting regular politics and acting without direction—such as the Bernie Sanders supporter who shot at members of Congress during a baseball game and the young progressive men who attack police officers believing they are supporting minority rights.57 However, far-left violence is rising, and could expand if prominent progressives begin espousing more militant sentiments.\n\nOn the right, one of the most worrisome aspects is the mainstreaming of violence. Most Americans who commit spontaneous hate crimes look similar demographically to other violent criminals: they are generally young, unmarried, childless, unemployed men with low levels of education who often have prior criminal records. In other words, individuals with an inherently aggressive personality, who might commit other violent criminal acts, are being fired up by the normalization of hate to direct their anger at more politically focused targets.\n\nBut the majority of those who commit organized political violence, such as on January 6 or at Stop the Steal events, are married, middle-class, middle-aged men with kids, jobs, and involvement in church or community groups. Those who were arrested for the January 6 insurrection mainly consumed mainstream media, not social media or far-right echo chambers.58 Many were nevertheless also members of extremist groups.59 Unlike those committing spontaneous hate crimes, this community of well-established Americans seems to see violence and intimidation as an extension of their political voice or even an act of citizenship, rather than a criminal or terrorist act.\n\nThat is a final, urgent reason for a step-change in focus: violence that has become mainstream is likely to grow and is vastly harder to counter.\n\nFive Strategies to Change the Trajectory and Improve American Democracy\n\nAmerica’s democracy faces two very different problems. An acute threat is emanating from a faction of Republican politicians who are trying to gain control over government to maintain power by reducing democracy. Their efforts build on long-term, slow-growing threats: a right where too many moderate conservatives are willing to support an antidemocratic faction to fend off the feared left, and a left where too many Americans aren’t sure they care enough about the democratic system of government to fight for it.\n\nToday’s acute threats were able to metastasize quickly because society’s immune system had been weakened by these long-term problems of polarization and decades of lost faith that democracy can deliver a better life. Thus, it isn’t enough to restore the status quo from just before the acute threat took hold—Americans must use this crisis to propel their country forward.\n\nSome of these tactics are short term, while others will take longer to come to fruition. All are difficult, but many have been achieved in countries far more violent and politically volatile than the United States is today. However, waiting on the long-term goals and prioritizing the immediate will not succeed. The U.S. and NATO war in Afghanistan demonstrated how fighting twenty years’ worth of one-year battles is a failing strategy.\n\nDemocracy proponents risk fighting endless two-year battles each election cycle, to equally failed results. Instead, addressing the acute threats requires attention to both electoral and social drivers (see table 1). I recommend five strategies:\n\nenable responsible conservatives to vote for democracy, reduce social demand from the right for illiberal policies and politicians, engage the left in defending democracy by making it deliver, build a broad-based, multistranded, prodemocracy movement around a positive vision concretized in locally rooted action, and strengthen accountability to reset norms on what behavior is legal and acceptable.\n\nEnable Responsible Conservatives to Vote for Democracy\n\nA democracy cannot exist with illiberal, antidemocratic politicians in charge. Over a third of Republicans believe the 2020 elections were free and fair. Were that third to vote for prodemocracy candidates alongside Democrats, the United States would look like many European countries, which have an angry minority of voters advancing smallish fringe parties rather than an existential challenge to democracy itself. Yet prodemocratic Republican voters continue to fuel an antidemocratic faction of their party because that faction is winning Republican primaries and mainstream conservatives simply cannot bear to support Democrats. For reasons of identity and policy, this is unlikely to change: Republican voting has not altered in large numbers in response to antidemocratic tactics, split-ticket voting is becoming extremely rare, and negative partisanship is very high.60\n\nSocial tactics such as bridge-building won’t affect electoral outcomes, either. There is zero evidence that changing an individual’s beliefs about other groups—such as helping someone feel more warmly toward immigrants or more secure in their social status—will alter voting behavior. Therefore, without immediate electoral and longer-term institutional changes that enable moderate Republicans to vote for prodemocracy Republican candidates against an antidemocratic faction, none of the social changes suggested later have the means to affect voting behavior in a way that will save the country’s democracy.\n\nSupport prodemocracy candidates in primary campaigns and general elections to ensure antidemocratic candidates lose and prodemocracy politicians of all parties win. If antidemocratic candidates win, opportunistic politicians will continue to support illiberalism and antidemocratic tropes because they see this as a winning election strategy, whether they believe in what they are saying or not. And because leaders have immense power to set social norms, they will contribute to this vicious cycle, even if they are simply mouthing attitudes they don’t actually endorse.61\n\nCandidates who amplify antidemocratic or violent rhetoric or imagery must bear electoral costs for that strategy. Tactically different but equally critical is ensuring that the heroic politicians of both parties who supported democracy in 2020 win. Both are important for changing momentum. This suggestion requires campaign funding, but it also requires innovative strategy: in Utah, for instance, the Democratic Party is choosing not to run its own candidate in a heavily conservative state but is instead backing an independent, prodemocracy candidate who has a chance.62\n\nThese short-term efforts are essential. They are also endless. They require immense expenditures every two years to hold the line: for example, the 2020 elections cost $14 billion for national campaigns alone, not counting races for state legislatures, governors, and secretaries of state.63 Addressing the roots of the problem also requires institutional reform.\n\nSupport primary election reform. Without institutional changes, fighting the antidemocratic faction is like trying to stop water flowing through a sieve. Safe seats force all candidates to cater to a more extreme base, meaning that in some elections, there will be no obviously prodemocratic candidate to support—every viable candidate may deny the legitimacy of the 2020 election. Because so many seats are now safe, primaries have become the real election for over 90 percent of Congress.64 That is why Representative Adam Kinzinger’s Country First movement recognizes that without primary reform, the effort to elect prodemocracy Republicans cannot move forward.65\n\nVarious forms of electoral change or majority-winner rules would allow for what amounts to a multiparty system within the two-party field, enabling same-party candidates to run against each other without being spoilers.66 These changes include: nonpartisan and open primaries (where voters don’t have to register to a party to vote in a primary or can vote in either parties’ primary), ranked choice voting (where voters rank several candidates in order of preference), and final-four or final-five voting (where politicians of the same party can run against one another). Other primary election reforms include fusion voting (where small parties such as the Greens or Working Families Party can cross-endorse), proportional representation (where the number of seats held by a political party is proportional to the vote for the party in that area, rather than a single candidate winning the entire jurisdiction by winning 50% +1 votes), and other systemic innovations. All of these alterations provide a prodemocracy way for conservatives to vote for prodemocracy conservatives without serving as spoilers or throwing a vote away. These sorts of systemic innovations, which should differ by state, would let partisans vote for prodemocracy candidates from their party. These innovations would also allow a fuller electorate to make their views known in places where one party determines who wins.\n\nAs a consequence of safe seats, the 2020 elections of Cawthorn, Greene, and Boebert were decided by 5 percent, 8.3 percent, and 10.3 percent of their electorates, respectively.67 But thanks to open primaries, at least 5,400 Democrats voted in the 2022 Republican primary, and Cawthorn lost by 1,500 votes. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger needed 27,000 votes to avoid a runoff and received over 37,000 from Democrats under Georgia’s open primary system.68\n\nInstitutional reform isn’t a silver bullet that can overcome having a real majority thanks to popularity and funding—Cawthorn’s outbursts against Republican colleagues and poor constituent services softened his support. Boebert, however, won her primary despite thousands of Democrats registering as Republicans, and Greene won her primary in part because she raised $9 million while the next most viable Republican had raised just over $390,000.69 Nevertheless, encouraging greater choice and agency for voters is an essential step for giving prodemocracy candidates a fighting chance. It also builds greater representation and trust in the system. It will not always yield moderation—as QAnon and election denialism grow, it could allow immoderate leaders to gain in some locations. The sooner that primary reform is implemented, and the more care that is given to the precise type of system in a given state, the less likely these pernicious effects will take hold—but this is a recommendation that has both crucial importance and an expiry date. It must start now.\n\nCreate a new identity for conservative Republicans to stand for prodemocratic beliefs. To break the connection between an illiberal social movement and a party, it is not enough to have an institutional way to vote for a conservative prodemocracy candidate. There must also be a brand, identity, and social group one can belong to so that a regular voter, candidate, or public official does not have to fear being painted as a “Republican in name only” (RINO) for supporting democracy.\n\nWhen conservatives have stood up one by one for democratic beliefs, they have been shamed, shunned, and punished, as with Liz Cheney, who lost her primary; former senator Jeff Flake, who chose not to run for reelection; and Cindy McCain, a former Arizona Republican kingmaker and the wife of the deceased senator and former Republican presidential candidate John McCain, who was censured by her own party. Never Trumpers—Republicans who publicly disavowed Trump—have lost jobs, friends, and even places of worship. Few people are attracted to a movement with such high personal costs for such abstract goals. Social norms play a strong role in how all groups, particularly authoritarian-leaning personalities, will act.70\n\nBuilding a large, strongly identified, conservative, prodemocratic grouping with which individuals can identify and belong without social opprobrium offers a permission structure for changing social norms. The grouping must be a movement, not an official nongovernmental organization—though it could be assisted by multiple such organizations—and it must be large enough to deter efforts to pick prominent personalities off one by one. This identity is essential for institutional reforms to generate value.\n\nReduce Social Demand From the Right for Illiberal Policies and Politicians\n\nAddress the status loss and dignity deficit that is driving some Americans to turn against democracy. The widespread feeling that the system is rigged, and that this intentionally tilted playing field has caused a once-privileged group to lose status (a feeling particularly strong among white Christian males), has opened a window for antidemocrats to empathize and offer explanations that boost their power. America cannot have a healthy democracy without addressing these social forces.\n\nRacism is clearly playing a dominant role in these dynamics, according to a multitude of studies.71 The problem, however, is intersectional. Beliefs about the properness of male dominance were more potent than racial beliefs in predicting whether men and women in 2016 and 2020 voted for Trump.72 Hostile sexism predicts support for political violence better than racism does. In both cases, however, there is correlation between these views and hostility toward people who are not white.73 Meanwhile, as Duke University political scientist Ashley Jardina has shown, mobilized white identity politics transcends class.74 So does hostile sexism. Plenty of college-educated White men (and some of the women who love them) feel their relative loss of status to minorities and women perhaps even more keenly, because they expect to be in the top place on the social spectrum. But class still plays a role: American men and women without college degrees hold more traditional views on gender, religion, and other issues.75 Today’s culture wars sideline economics in order to unite non-college-educated Americans with many White people, men, and working class or male minorities, particularly Hispanics who may hold more traditional religious beliefs and gender norms.\n\nTo many American liberals, this may feel like the perfect moment for a comeuppance. But the impulse to rub White male noses in their perceived status loss plays right into the hands of authoritarians.\n\nThe weaponization of cultural issues is allowing what had been social divisions in the culture wars of the 1960s and partisan divides in the culture wars of the 1980s to fuel an authoritarian movement today.\n\nPolitical organizers build political identity around a “story of self, a story of us, and a story of now,” in pioneering community organizer Marshall Ganz’s words—or, as Ian Haney López writes, who we are, what status we hold, who validates us, and who threatens us.76 Recognizing that men, White people, Christians, and working-class Americans are all grappling with their relative loss of status over the past fifty years, an antidemocratic faction has woven a successful narrative. Soft and sometimes explicit versions of the so-called great replacement theory claim that White people, men, and Christians are being displaced from their positions by minorities, women, and immigrants who are being let into the country or elevated to power by Democrats, Jews, “the government,” or “elites.” The QAnon claims of blood-drinking, satanic pedophiles supported by a “deep state” sound crazy, but they are actually a version of this story—one that paradoxically appeals less to self-interest and more to the helper impulse by saying that Christian childrens’ souls are under threat from Democratic elites who hold cultural and political power. With stakes so high, democracy must be curtailed to save Christianity, White people, and men or, in a softer version, the Christian-European heritage that has made America great.\n\nThe story explains why some groups are losing status, validates some individuals’ difficulty competing, and provides immediacy to antidemocratic efforts to keep other Americans permanently away from power. But the Trumpist faction of the Republican Party offers more than ideology. Like any good organizing effort, it also provides understanding and community, potent offerings in an age where anomie and loneliness are at alarming levels.\n\nThe weaponization of cultural issues is allowing what had been social divisions in the culture wars of the 1960s and partisan divides in the culture wars of the 1980s to fuel an authoritarian movement today.\n\nThe authoritarian movement is cultivating a story that puts men, Christians, and White people at the top of a status hierarchy. The prodemocracy community must remain inclusive and liberal—but writing off all members of these groups as racist or unsaveable simply thrusts them closer together. Instead, the democracy movement must understand how this story brings out the worst in many individuals who also have better selves. Rather than pushing them to bond further with the authoritarian movement, it is crucial to separate allies from within these groups who will support inclusive democracy. That sounds unappealing to many who wish to write off much of America and move forward without them. But if prodemocracy efforts don’t reach people who are feeling their loss of status and seeking explanations, then authoritarian politicians, male-chauvinist Proud Boys, incel chat boards, hypermasculine militia movements, and myriad white nationalist groups are happy to recruit them instead.\n\nOnce a status hierarchy is created, it is not just those at the top who maintain it. People tend to make their most socially respected identity the most salient. Therefore, some middle- and working-class men tie themselves to a higher rung by emphasizing their whiteness. Hostile sexism is also common among women, many of whom hold onto ideas of rightful male dominance and anti-female attitudes to raise their status within the right-wing hierarchy. The population with the greatest support for anti-Semitic views are young conservative Latino men, and second highest is young conservative Black men.77\n\nBut not all those who support a traditional hierarchy are trying to put others down. For some working-class families facing the brutal realities of raising kids while one parent works a morning shift and the other has shift work at night, attaining traditional stay-at-home motherhood is a mark of success and family stability. These families resent elites with choices for sneering at a goal they hope to someday achieve.78 Minority men and immigrants may emphasize their identity as hard-working and law-abiding or focus on their work identities as small business owners, and they may not want to share their hard-fought gains with others whom they don’t feel followed the same rules. For instance, Pew Research Center found that 19 percent of Latino people favored Trump’s border wall in 2018, a figure that rose to 48 percent among Latino conservatives.79 One in ten African Americans today are immigrants and may identify more with gender norms from their home countries, or with a story of immigrant striving, than with the struggle against American racism.80 Others may feel their masculinity or religious beliefs are more important to them than their race or ethnic identity and may support traditional, but not hostile, relationships with women.\n\nThe fact that people have many identities to choose from helps explain why the Hispanic vote for Trump increased by over a third between 2016 and 2020, the Black male vote doubled, and even the Asian vote grew.81 While racism clearly played the largest role in motivating swing voters toward the Trumpist Republican faction in 2016 and continues to be an effective dog whistle, voting shifts in 2020 clarify that other factors are also driving the social support for authoritarian policies.82\n\nFor White, working-class men and women, for example, suicide, opioid addiction, and alcoholism have lowered life expectancies—an unprecedented fate for a developed country.83 Men of all races without college degrees also face low marriage rates, high births out of wedlock, and declining social capital, all of which leave them lonelier. Women will soon out-graduate men from college two to one. America now has a large reservoir of men under 30—the most violence-prone group in any society—who have low levels of education, lack marriage possibilities and access to steady and well-paying jobs, feel humiliated by their low status in a country where downward mobility is seen as personal failure and in a working class culture where they expect themselves to be providers, and who must also hear high-status individuals tell them how privileged they are because of their gender and possibly race.\n\nAnger at having these more complex cultural, economic, and identity concerns dismissed by elites as racism is being harnessed and weaponized by adversaries of democracy. Feelings of disrespect are being cultivated by an antidemocratic faction to drive together a large contingent of the country. Decades of studies of international insurgencies suggest that answering the legitimate grievances of groups, particularly concerns about corruption or unfairness, is important for diffusing conflict. How can the prodemocracy community stop unwittingly fusing these groups together and instead untangle this skein by understanding and answering the grievances that can be legitimately addressed?\n\nOf course, working-class White people continue to hold privilege over working-class people of color historically and currently in hiring, housing, and many other spheres. But the knowledge that someone else has it worse does not erase a sense of resentment when one’s life is tough enough and people with vastly greater wealth and power deride its difficulty. There are also real costs to a strategy of competitive victimhood, rather than a politics of inclusivity. Jardina has found that white identity politics emerge periodically in times where the White population feels under threat, such as the current demographic moment.84 But even in such eras, the 30 to 40 percent of White people who feel a growing sense of white identity can avoid accompanying that feeling with racial hostility—if fears of threat are calmed. There are many ways to calm such fears—such as unionization, which elevates the role of class in one’s identity, or more inclusive rhetoric that ties issues of class and race together. Instead, unfortunately, it is not just the right that is increasing the sense of threat. Left-wing tropes about the coming majority-minority country and simplistic concepts of racial identity amplify White people’s anxiety and ironically increase the likelihood that a white sense of identity will be accompanied by racism and actions against other groups, from voting contrary to minority interests to actual violence. For instance, researchers have found that priming White college students who identify strongly with their white identity to think about white privilege led them to express greater racial resentment.85\n\nDisarming the political weaponization of masculinity, race, religion, and class requires efforts that:\n\nReduce extremism within particularly at-risk populations such as evangelicals, veterans, and discrete right-wing communities supportive of violence by supporting organizations already trusted by these populations to reduce chances for extremist recruitment, build moderate voices, and create social groups supportive of speaking in favor of democracy and against violence.\n\nInvest in a positive vision of masculinity and masculine citizenship. The movement to offer more positive views of women’s and girls’ roles in society has been of immense importance to altering social norms over the last fifty years. Yet it has not been accompanied by mass efforts to craft a mainstream, positive view of masculinity to stand alongside these empowered women and girls. On the right, efforts to create a positive masculine vision have curdled toward reinforcing male dominance.86 Among progressives, understanding of the concept of “toxic masculinity” is strong, but a positive vision that holds space for emotionally and socially healthy men who also like pickup trucks, hunting, physical labor, physical strength, and traditionally masculine pursuits is not. And neither vision is clear on where nonbinary individuals fit into their views on gender.\n\nThis need for a new masculine frame that affirms a positive vision of masculinity is also important because of the interlinked nature of white male citizenship and guns in America today. Political scientist Alexandra Filindra found that, in 2015, 43 percent of White men viewed owning a gun as a sign of good citizenship, a view particularly strong among White male gun owners who score high on surveys of anti-Black prejudice.87 These views have deep roots: laws since the nation’s founding have conflated White men bearing arms with community protection. In the early days of America’s colonies, and again after the Civil War, some states legislated that White men were required to bear arms, while Black men were barred from doing so.88 While gun ownership can certainly coincide with being prodemocracy in the twenty-first century, that confluence requires notions of masculinity that encourage self-control—something the United States has actively supported in programming in places like Afghanistan.89 In the current moment of heightened political violence, finding ways to differentiate White male citizenship from so-called community protection would reduce the traction that militias such as the Oathkeepers and Three Percenters have gained. These militias depend on the notion that armed protest and vigilante community protection are acts of citizenship similar to voting.\n\nLike all human beings, men need to feel that they hold roles that are valued in society, not in spite of but because of who they are. They cannot simply be admonished to refrain from negative actions—they require a positive and aspirational view of manhood that enables their full selves rather than requiring them to stifle parts of their identities. For instance, values that support democracy, such as honor, responsibility, hard work, and sacrifice, are among the virtues associated with masculinity by traditionalists.\n\nFor a healthy twenty-first-century society, these roles must support empowered women and nonbinary individuals, not come at their expense. Similarly, men must perceive that empowering women and nonbinary individuals also supports individual men’s well-being, not that the groups are in competition for the top of a hierarchy. Programs intended to build such mutual regard are regularly incorporated into work in developing nations such as India, where some microcredit programs for women, for instance, also work with men to show them how wives who can read and save money actually support their families and their husbands’ social ranks rather than undermine poor men’s fragile grip on status.\n\nThere is a nascent effort to create healthy visions of masculinity in the United States. It includes ad campaigns for mainstream male products, nonprofits that focus on sports and other pursuits while bringing in more attuned ideas of manhood, and school programs that teach emotional intelligence and regulation skills to students of all genders.90 America needs more programs like these, as well as programs that offer healthy visions of mutually supportive and empowered genders within evangelical Christianity, where a negative version of masculinity has taken hold in recent decades.91\n\nRethink how economic structures could better support democracy. Though class and inequality are components of America’s social divisions, government-led economic redistribution won’t address the problems of democracy. Government redistribution programs actually increase the threats to masculinity by deepening a sense of dependence. Reforms that are means-tested are particularly disliked by working- and middle-class Americans, who are more motivated by the fear of losing what they have to higher taxes than by the prospect of gaining more. Their disgruntlement is enhanced when programs are targeted at those who have even less, pitting the working class against those who are not working.92 Finally, years of dog-whistle politics have succeeded in inaccurately relating means-tested redistribution programs with African Americans, meaning that government redistribution measures intended to reduce inequality and poverty tends to increase racism.93 America can take a page from the international development field, which has spent twenty years learning that government-provided services intended to enhance government legitimacy can backfire because of the inevitable jealousies and misinformation that arise over who gets what, when.94\n\nDespite these problems with simple redistribution to ameliorate class grievances, the long-term loss of well-paying (and often male) manufacturing and other laboring jobs is playing a deep role in disempowering people who want to draw dignity from work and, instead, pushing them to look to more polarizing identity markers such as race for status.\n\nAmerican democracy does not need a simplistic redistribution that, however well-intentioned, backfires, but it does need a deeper rethinking of how economic structures could better support democracy and a holistic approach to how to alter them—the sort of work the Hewlett Foundation is supporting.95 Democratic scholars since Aristotle have noted that a broad middle class is crucial to democracy, while a resentful class facing loss is a major risk, acute poverty can be co-opted by politicians offering handouts, and oligarchic concentrations of wealth skew voters, policy, and politicians. The prodemocracy community would do well to revive an old strain of democratic thought that also grounded the thinking of some of the country’s founders, who believed that policymakers must consider how economic structures help or harm democracy—from concentrations of wealth to forms of work that remove the habits of free choice or association.96\n\nReturn social status and higher wages to laboring jobs that don’t require a college education. The Great Resignation and the low unemployment rate offer an opportunity to return better pay and, just as important, respect, to jobs that require manual labor but not college degrees.\n\nNearly two-thirds of American men don’t have a college degree. And today, they are significantly less likely than women to complete high school, to enroll in college, and to graduate college.97 Society’s respect for working-class labor therefore affects most men. It is also possible that conservative, white-collar men view attitudes toward traditionally male laboring jobs as proxies for society’s respect for traditional male status.\n\nThe lower status of non-college-degree-requiring jobs also plays into hostile sexism. Starting with the generation born in 1974, women have consistently outpaced men educationally. Many White men seem to have made a personal choice not to compete with women—about four in ten claim they “just don’t want to” continue schooling, transforming an aspirational norm of universal college education into a source of resentment.98\n\nThat means that rhetoric matters as much as programming. For instance, former president Barack Obama vastly increased the nation’s apprenticeship programs, and Trump increased them as well—but Obama also vocally emphasized college as a goal that everyone should reach for, undermining the status his programs could have given to these skilled-labor jobs.\n\nHow well a job pays and how much attention it receives from government leaders can serve as indicators of status if consciously deployed to serve that function. Political leaders should be encouraged to support apprenticeships, short-term training, certifications, and other skilled labor programs, as well as considering programs such as community-college-with-training efforts.99 The Chamber of Commerce and local business communities could support privately funded but similar programs, as well as deploy supportive rhetoric. In some fields, reducing credentialing requirements might be useful for cutting barriers to entry.100 In others, gradients of credentialing might provide greater status and income to skilled laborers, so long as these barriers are not used to exclude minority groups. These are empirical questions that require studying by industry.\n\nUnions can also help bring greater recognition and financial compensation to these roles. Unionization also appears to have the positive effect of reducing racism, possibly by emphasizing class solidarity over racial difference: studies have found that gaining union membership between 2010 and 2016 reduced racial resentment among White workers.101\n\nRevitalize rural America. The decline of rural America is leaving the rural working class in an economic riptide, constantly pulling their stability out from under them. A problem rooted in economics has spread to opioid addiction and violence: the murder rate that has risen nationwide since 2020 also rose sharply in rural America, particularly in red states.102 The geographic concentration of violence means that in urban areas, the 30 percent rise in murders the United States experienced largely affects people living in a few very hard hit blocks. In a rural area, the same rate of increase is felt across a community because there are so many fewer people.103 Yet working-class Americans, who make up a greater percentage of rural America, are less likely to move due to the value they place on family, geographic roots, and economic needs that encourage them to remain near family homes and support systems.104\n\nNeither party has addressed this problem well, but antidemocratic forces are succeeding in framing the enemies as immigrants, Jews, people of color, and coastal elites who look down on the hard work, values, and needs of so-called flyover country. While both the working class and White demographics moved away from Trump in 2020 compared to 2016, rural voters increased their support for the Trumpist Republican faction.105 Because the Senate and electoral college give particular power to rural voters, these lived realities combined with adept framing are having immense electoral consequences.\n\nRemoving or seriously addressing the following grievances might help. The needed efforts are partially economic. But they are also about ensuring that regulations are appropriate to rural areas, where life is quite different than city life. They are also about returning agency to rural areas, where the ability to control one’s destiny is of particular personal value and yet has been denuded due to economic forces, educational failures, and government regulations. Economic, social, and cultural efforts to revive rural America are unlikely to affect partisan voting—but they may be important to reducing the sense of grievance of being left behind that is fueling an extremist, authoritarian faction within a party.\n\nChange the information space by fighting disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation and by rebuilding local media. Realities regarding status loss and who or what is to blame are seen through the prism of perceptions, not facts. Those perceptions are strongly shaped by the media. Much has been made of social media’s pernicious effects on democracy. Its algorithms and business models exacerbate outrage and anger.106 They also help recruit and provide platforms to extremists.107\n\nBut in Europe, social media has not been found to have the polarizing effects that it has in the United States—some studies show that it can actually help bridge divides in highly polarized countries.108 A cross-country study on affective polarization finds that in the United States, the phenomenon predates the internet and correlates more closely with the rise of cable news.109 Surveys also find extremely negative democratic effects from far-right and right-wing television and radio such as Newsmax, One America News, and Fox, rather than social media.110 That finding is corroborated by studies of those who attended the January 6 rally. Only one-tenth of arrested insurrectionists received most of their news from social media; most favored conservative television and radio.111\n\nIn other words: the broader media environment determines the ways that social media affects a population. Together, right-wing radio, television, and social media form an echo chamber in which traditional conservative media is as serious a problem as social media. Both traditional and social media must be addressed to affect disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation. Meanwhile, a strong local news environment and the existence of trusted medias of record can reduce polarization and help democracy even without changes to social media.112\n\nProgramming for solutions in the social media realm should consider three audiences who are affected differently by social media. The largest is a general audience who engages almost entirely with entertainment and social news. This population rarely chooses to consume political news on purpose. Since they, like most people, have homogenous groups of friends offline, social media’s weak links to old acquaintances often helps them become more open-minded and less polarized.\n\nNext, a small, highly partisan audience is becoming more entrenched in its views thanks to social media. For them, social media is highly polarizing. Most of their feeds reinforce the rightness of their views, while the occasional opposing viewpoints from former friends or family polarizes them further. More media-sophisticated partisans are more susceptible to sharing misinformation and are more resistant to correction.113 This problem is occurring on the left and right; more educated, media-consuming liberals tend to have the most distorted views of the other party, while affective hatred and sharing of misinformation may be slightly greater among Republicans, possibly because they are older or because of the deeper echo chamber of both online and offline media on the right. Because highly educated partisans are the social group that is closest to most prodemocracy activists, these polarizing effects of media tend to resonate with the prodemocracy world and this groups’ experiences are often seen as the whole landscape.\n\nThe third audience is the smallest but the most dangerous. It consists of individuals who seek out more specialized platforms such as 4chan, 8kun, Gab, and closed groups on Facebook, Telegram, and other sites in which to revel in hateful memes and jokes. This same small group also interacts differently with mainstream social media: studies of YouTube show that most engagement with extremist content on that platform was largely confined to a small, concentrated group of people who had preexisting negative views on gender and race.114 The amount of hateful discussion in these online fora is predictive of offline action. People who frequent hate sites are densely connected, seem to be mobilized to retweet more frequently, and are coordinated for attack.\n\nThese online populations follow a classic power law: a small number of people are responsible for a great deal of the online problem.\n\nActions to mitigate the dangers of social media should take these different audiences into account, focusing most action on the third group and undertaking careful, empirically tested work on the second. For the first group, simply providing easy access to good information is often enough. Efforts should aim to:\n\nRebuild local news sources. Trusted local media appears to serve as a bulwark against rabbit holes, democracy-eroding corruption, and polarization.115 Local media is also correlated with a host of prodemocratic habits from voting and split-ticket voting to civic participation. Local media appears to amplify the effects of countermeasures that help fight disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation.116 Its eclipse in recent years has opened space for more polarized news.117 Supporting many efforts underway to reinvigorate local journalism and provide local news sources to communities helps break polarization and democratic decline.\n\nLaunch mass campaigns using positive messaging to meet people’s information needs’ information needs and inoculation techniques to fight extremism.118 Inoculation techniques and efforts as simple as suggesting that people look up from their computers and connect with their families have been shown to deescalate violence and stop the spread of disinformation, even among deeply committed antidemocrats.119 These must be driven by constant testing and can be employed to pull people away from disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation and toward more positive community and family associations.120\n\nA significant number of people find their way down rabbit holes into disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation because good information appears lower in algorithms and thus in search results—or because facts appear behind paywalls that block poorer and less-partisan individuals. Fox News is free; the Washington Post, the New York Times, and many local news sites are not. The democracy movement should invest in web-savvy campaigns and consultants as part and parcel of all philanthropic giving to ensure that it is easy for people to find good information and avoid bad.\n\nAdvocate for social media platforms to deplatform high-profile individuals but only demote vitriolic but lower-profile accounts as deplatforming can exacerbate their extremism, for the gaming industry to promote efforts for self-policing, and for Congress to regulate the core business model of social media platforms that profit from outrage and polarization. These advocacy efforts are hard and slow-moving but could all help fight disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation.\n\nCarefully deploy impact litigation against echo chambers responsible for defamation and other antidemocratic activities that are also illegal, to deter media propagandizing.121\n\nEngage the Left in Defending Democracy by Making It Deliver\n\nWhile a faction of the right is seeking to use government to undermine democracy, Democrats are underalarmed about the threat. That might be in part because of recent wins: trust in elections tends to be influenced by whether one’s side has won or lost, as well as elite framing about the voting experience. Thus, Democrats actually had particularly high levels of trust in the 2020 election, and only 35 percent of Democrats express concern about democracy being stolen.122\n\nBut the lack of alarm on the left about the loss of democracy may also be because many on the left, particularly minority voters and poor voters, keep being asked to turn out to vote to save democracy, disregarding the fact that democracy keeps failing to meet their needs. Organizations that purport to represent the poor or minorities cannot rally their base around abstractions like democracy if voting does not deliver concrete value for their lives.\n\nWhile the acute threats to democracy are largely emanating from the right, Americans cannot build a brighter future without addressing the long-term concerns of those who are so disillusioned with government that they do not see the democratic system as one that serves them. The need for status and reassurance on the part of groups traditionally higher on the social and political hierarchy cannot be provided at the expense of groups that have long been left out of the full fruits of democracy.\n\nHigh-quality studies of Black and Latino communities find that these groups’ policy desires focus on economic improvements (such as fighting inflation, supporting better-paying jobs, affordable housing, quality and affordable healthcare, and access to college education), reducing racism, improving air and water quality in their immediate neighborhoods rather than broad climate change issues, improving public schools, and reducing crime and improving criminal justice or immigration reform—in roughly that order.123 Voting and democracy issues show up at the bottom of the list. In part, that may be because significant pluralities feel that voting does not matter because neither party is seen as advancing these concrete needs.124 These views are especially strong among people under age fifty. The problem lies partially in communicating successes but largely in actually moving the bar.125 People cannot be rallied around democracy when they are worried that their kids are going to school in trailers, their babies are going hungry, they can’t pay for healthcare, and voting did not change anything. And while many in racial and ethnic minorities in the middle and upper classes don’t feel these acute needs personally, they may identify with fellow members of their racial or ethnic communities. To change the tide, organizations should focus on the following efforts.\n\nConnect democracy to real social and economic needs, particularly of underserved communities. Democracy organizations should recognize that democracy cannot remain abstract—it must be embodied in addressing actual needs that affect real people and in localities closest to the voters. The various communities that compose the left are less likely to support democracy goals unless they see solid movement on issues that matter to them and view that movement as being supported by organizations that purport to stand for democracy. Core organizations in the prodemocracy universe need to make a much greater effort to reach out across racial and class lines, not just ideological divides, by supporting these communities on concrete needs that matter to them.\n\nHighlight how failures of democracy are among the reasons social and economic goals are not being met. Groups organized to promote social and economic justice should include democracy in their agendas. For instance, the National Urban League has done this in practice by crafting its latest State of Black America analysis around issues of voter suppression.126 In Michigan, some organizations have emphasized how unelected emergency managers taking over disproportionately Black municipalities and being unresponsive to voters was a prime cause of the Flint water crisis.127\n\nRecognize that the programs to address status anxiety among men and the working class described above also apply to minority working class men and should be crafted and framed to help both communities. Democrats used to be the party of the working class; its strong pillars of support among minorities and the college-educated have diluted this economic focus. Republicans have always included business elites and are now welcoming the working class, but they do so by setting aside class and racial issues and prioritizing shared cultural beliefs. These shifts are leaving specific interests of working-class minorities off the policy agendas of both parties.\n\nEfforts to build a positive vision of masculinity; boost status and salaries for skilled labor; and counter disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation (which disproportionately target Black and Latino users online) will assist minority men and working-class minorities on the left just as they help the white working class and men on the right. The key is to ensure that these programs do not have structures (explicit or unintentional) that serve as barriers to these participating communities. Structuring programs to appeal across race would be ideal. But in some cases, different substance as well as outreach will be needed: for instance, White men and minorities are being targeted differently by disinformation, requiring specific programming.\n\nProvide information tailored to what minority groups are looking for. Government programs and organizations focused on democracy and social and economic justice cannot ignore the role of information access in achieving their goals. While much of the left’s democratic dissatisfaction is about actually delivering policies that improve equality of opportunity and reduce systemic bias, too many democracy and social justice organizations are failing to effectively communicate what has been accomplished by politicians and organizations or offer effective means of agency. Much of the antidemocracy disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation that disproportionately targets minority communities reaches them because typical searches for information do not turn up what they are looking for.\n\nSome of this is a problem of media paywalls mentioned before. Paying for news seems particularly unlikely among those who rarely seek out political information anyway. Another problem is created by not providing information to groups in the ways and at the times that they use it. For instance, the quick spread of the term “Latinx” among educated progressives ignores the fact that just 3 percent of people of Hispanic heritage use the term.128 That discrepancy means that when most Latino Americans search for information on the web, they are going to miss information from groups that use Latinx and will find information that is specifically targeted to the search terms they use. Often, algorithms direct immigrants toward information from their countries of origin, including Spanish-language sites overseas that have been inundated with Russian disinformation.\n\nGreater web savvy and attention to cost in order to reach minority and working-class audiences is not a nice addition to democracy programming; it is essential to fund because it is crucial to meeting people where they are.\n\nAddress police brutality, criminal justice reform, and community safety together. For years, political parties have failed poor and minority communities by addressing the issues of criminal violence and police brutality separately.\n\nDemocratic trust is deeply harmed when the police, some of the most visible representatives of the state, act with brutality or bias. In fact, globally, a sense that the state is impartial in exercising power is one of the greatest builders of trust in government and in fellow citizens, while unequal justice is one of the fastest ways to lose governmental legitimacy.129\n\nYet plans to address the problems of brutal and unequal policing must also grapple with the reality that civilian-on-civilian homicide is far and away the greatest cause of death for Black men in their twenties, larger than the next five causes combined.130 The concentration of homicide in urban areas falls vastly, disproportionately on minorities—these deaths, coupled with a clearance rate in which fewer than half of all homicides in America are now solved, are one of the most-important and least-discussed equity issues in the country.131\n\nTo mobilize against criminal violence and ignore state violence, or to protect people from the state only to leave them prey to street violence, solves no one’s actual needs for safety. Criminal justice reform is at risk of being undone by rising crime levels. These issue sets need to be addressed together, with empirical evidence, to help communities that deserve protection by the state and, too often, from the state.132 This means that work to root out extremism in law enforcement must be pursued aggressively.133 But it must be carried out with the police wherever possible, so that it can take place alongside evidence-based work, such as focusing on the few places where most crime occurs and the few people who commit the most violent crime, to reduce the skyrocketing murder rate, which had the largest rise in over a century in 2020.134 Solution sets may also lie outside traditional thinking about crime, such as exploring the role cognitive behavioral therapy can play, a particular need in minority communities underserved by trauma-informed therapy.135\n\nBuild a Broad-based, Multistranded, Prodemocracy Movement Around a Positive Vision Concretized in Locally Rooted Action\n\nMore than half of all Americans believe the country’s best days are behind them as a nation.136 Many feel the system is corrupt and not worth saving. Serious, positive, prodemocracy work is currently confined to a small circle of people who are disproportionately middle to upper class, White, and talk mainly to each other. Yet international democracy-support research is crystal clear: mobilizing major change in polarized democracies requires broad-based constituencies of unlikely allies. International examples suggest that people are motivated by positive messages and concrete actions. In the context of U.S. democracy, eschewing national messages and issues in favor of local change is the best way to build on the trust that remains in the system and to evade partisan polarization.\n\nDecades of international work to support democracy have found that broad-based social movements are the key to overturning authoritarian systems and that their strength lies not just in numbers but also in their breadth across polarized divides.137 America maintains a democracy, which is why the electoral components of enabling responsible conservatives to vote for democracy remain so important. But Americans can draw lessons from movements that have succeeded against more authoritarian odds.138\n\nIdeological partisanship is not the only divide that must be overcome to build a united, prodemocracy movement.\n\nAll government systems rely on pillars of support to maintain legitimacy, such as the business community, religious leaders, the media, police, and the military. These pillars are composed of individuals with complex personal goals, identities, and needs. Movements to support democracy need to get more of these pillars to vocally join the prodemocracy side and eschew active, or more often passive, support for antidemocratic activities. Attracting key individuals and groups within various pillars to stand publicly on the side of democracy signals to mainstream society that they, too, can stand for prodemocracy goals without fear of retaliation. It is also essential for overcoming the polarization that allows authoritarianism to grow with voter support.\n\nIdeological partisanship is not the only divide that must be overcome to build a united, prodemocracy movement. Many indicators of democratic health in America move in different directions based on race, class, or age. For example, trust is a society’s immune system, and it enables communities to unite against threats and come together to solve problems.139 Political trust in institutions is based in social trust, or a belief that others will follow publicly understood social norms and that broad values and expectations of each other are shared.\n\nThe decline in trust in democratic institutions and in fellow Americans over the last sixty years (with a sharp acceleration over the last twenty) is well documented.140 What is less known is that trust in government actually bottomed out under Obama, hitting just 5 percent and 6 percent for the so-called silent and boomer generations, respectively. But for Black Americans, it was rising at the moment when it was at rock-bottom for White Americans, who remain the demographic majority. Ominously, Black and White peoples’ trust levels in government started moving in opposite directions at that time and have continued to do so—suggesting that policies and politicians who enhance the trust of one group are lowering the trust of another. Americans cannot build broad-based trust without bridging this racial divide.\n\nMeanwhile Gen Z has the lowest level of trust of any generation and far less attachment to democracy.141 They need to be brought into the prodemocracy space with efforts that are particular to their generation. This may entail civic education with international and historic examples of just what more can be lost and positive examples of what can be accomplished with broad-based action.\n\nFinally, one of the few issues that unites Americans across parties is the widely held view that the system as a whole is rigged toward elites. This “vertical polarization” gets less attention than left-right polarization, but it is just as acute, has enabled populist politicians to gain ground, and causes democracy messaging to fall flat for audiences who feel that the so-called democracy is actually tilted against them.142\n\nUnifying a prodemocracy movement must thus work not only across parties but across racial, generational, and class-cultural divides, while bringing in key societal pillars, such as businesses, religious institutions, and the military. It also must speak to divisions within these groups. Many racial minorities are progressive in some areas but hold more traditional religious beliefs, and many immigrants are both racial minorities and believe they can rise to the top of America through hard work and do not wish to solidify outsider identities.\n\nProdemocracy movement must be grounded in a positive vision of what the country could be\n\nAuthoritarians rely on division—their strategy is to use fear and anger to divide society in order to get different parts of society on their side or at least to feel conflicted enough to remain passive. Deepening divisions, even for discrete prodemocratic ends, thus helps the authoritarian playing field. Yet deepening and sharpening divisions is precisely what most partisan, get-out-the-vote messaging does. International experience in building broad-based movements, as well as U.S.-based efforts to fight disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation show that it’s easier to mobilize with a negative vision—but that it is not enough to sustain success. Manifold movements with “Enough!” in their names have won battles against authoritarian governments globally, only to lose their democracies to backlash when they try to consolidate a new system absent a positive, inclusive vision. Even when prodemocracy candidates and issues win using negative or fear-based messaging, it deepens polarization and thus invites backlash that entrenches the authoritarian playing field and enhances the authoritarian advantage over time. And when they lose, they increase nihilism and hopelessness.\n\nA prodemocracy movement must be grounded in a positive vision of what the country could be if everyone could see themselves and their children as benefiting in the future, rather than a zero-sum game to be won. In the same way that the efforts mentioned in the previous two sections could help White, right-wing men leaning toward extremism and could also assist African American men disaffected with decades of systemic mistreatment, some of the cure for the country’s democratic ills requires recognizing where complex identities and needs intersect. These ideas and feelings must be concretized in images, grounded in philosophy and policy ideas, and made real through actions.\n\nFinally, local methods of engagement help people gain agency and stay grounded in what is clearly real—not what nationalized media tells them is happening. Some of this engagement will entail local changes to the ways democracy is practiced. But prodemocracy work cannot be entirely political, otherwise it self-limits to a small slice of the citizenry who cares about politics. Americans must be reminded of what it means to come together and how that feels, through positive, apolitical group pursuits that offer moments of collective emotion—sports, concerts, community service, dance. These are all ways to emotionally engage Americans who may be too polarized to participate in prodemocracy activities in the political sphere or who may simply not be interested in politics.\n\nMovement Building\n\nBuild a movement that brings together unlikely allies. Right and left, minorities and law enforcement, evangelical Christians and nonreligious individuals, younger Americans and older voters, businesses and unions—all of them need to be positive, active or passive parts of a broad-based, prodemocratic social movement in which members of every group can see themselves participating.\n\nTo bring together unlikely allies without losing flanks, as much work must be done to craft intraparty and intragroup solidarity for democracy as is dedicated to cross-group efforts. A conservative prodemocracy movement must not be branded as anticonservative; a liberal prodemocracy movement cannot be viewed as sacrificing core progressive goals. Liberals and conservatives who come together for democracy cannot simply be in the centers of their parties or come from one generation or race.\n\nWhile on the right, intraparty work already omits violent individuals who have placed themselves on the antidemocratic side, on the left, more work is needed to address those willing to tolerate violence against businesses, personal property, and law enforcement. Research on broad-based movements shows that they must absolutely eschew violence of any type, even from aligned movements or flanks, because it quickly turns mainstream sentiment against them and reduces their breadth.143 Careful engagement must take place with groups that might otherwise use violence to achieve their ends.\n\nEfforts to bring together intragroup and cross-group coalitions for democracy, build trust, and eventually engage in public actions will often be slow and under the radar; trust takes time and can be harmed by too much early public scrutiny. Despite slow returns on investment, these conferences, meetings, strategy sessions, and other trust-building and coalition-building activities are essential.\n\nNarrative, Vision, and Philosophy\n\nCraft a positive, forward-looking, inclusive vision of America that provides a place for all Americans while gaining precedence over divisive visions on the right and left. This is not a recommendation about communications alone—Americans must first believe in a positive future as a single country and then articulate and imagine that future before they can communicate it.\n\nTyranny requires the consent of those tyrannized—Putin controls Russia because many Russians believe nothing can be changed and that nihilism is the only reasonable response. People like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are so dangerous to Putin’s regime because they show people that a better path is possible. The United States is not facing tyranny but the hopelessness of fighting fellow Americans to a stalemate. For good reason, the prodemocracy community is barely able to think beyond avoiding a stolen election in 2024. But as important as that goal is, it is hardly something to look forward to. Many Americans are demoralized by crime, inflation, and the fear of a downwardly mobile future for their children; they also cannot envision what the American dream looks like for them. Recent Supreme Court rulings are deepening polarization. A zero-sum, scarcity mindset cannot craft a way out of polarization and sclerosis.\n\nNarratives must offer a common, hopeful view of America in which all Americans can see themselves as potentia", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/new-report-finds-169-percent-surge-anti-asian-hate-crimes-n1265756", "title": "New report finds 169 percent surge in anti-Asian hate crimes during ...", "text": "A new compilation of hate crime data reveals that the increase in attacks against Asian Americans has only persisted.\n\nThe research, released by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, compared data from the first quarter of 2021 to the same time period in 2020 across 15 major cities. It found that hate crimes surged by 169 percent, continuing the \"historic\" increase in such attacks last year.\n\nVan C. Tran, a sociologist and associate professor at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, said crimes have increased across the board during the coronavirus pandemic, so the rise in attacks isn't necessarily surprising. However, the data are particularly concerning as they show that the targeting of Asian Americans in particular has \"exploded.\"\n\n\"What is unfortunate here is the fact that much of that hate and racism are being targeted towards one very small community in terms of population size,\" Tran said.\n\nAccording to the analysis, New York City had the sharpest increase, rising from 13 hate crimes in the first quarter of 2020 to 42 in the same period this year, a 223 percent jump. San Francisco, another city with a large Asian American population, also had a surge, from five to 12 hate crimes, a 140 percent increase. Boston and Los Angeles had rises of 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively.\n\nA report from the center in March showed that hate crimes increased by 150 percent in major cities last year.\n\nThe initial spike took place in March and April of last year, alongside an increase in U.S. Covid-19 cases, a rise in rhetoric that stigmatized the Asian community and an official declaration of a pandemic by the World Health organization, the report said.\n\nAsian Americans have experienced sudden increases in hate crimes before, for example after the 2014 report detailing North Korea's human rights violations and the 2018 tariff dispute between the U.S. and China. But the spikes weren't as large, and they didn't last as long as the one recorded this year.\n\nA recent Pew Research study found that about one-fifth of Asian Americans directly attributed the attacks to former President Donald Trump and his \"China virus\" rhetoric. Tran said that while Trump created a \"nightmare scenario\" of normalizing racist remarks and behaviors, the surge of hate crimes — and anti-Asian racism in general — can't be pinned to any single cause.\n\nAnother factor is the political awakening among Asian Americans during the pandemic, Tran said. While the community has long underreported hate crimes, he said, there may be more willingness to speak up now than ever before because of the activism catalyzed by the attacks.\n\nTran also said the heightened media attention to the issue, along with other tragedies affecting the Asian American community, like shootings at three Atlanta-area spas and a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, could have prompted more scrutiny and therefore more accurate reporting of hate crimes.\n\nAnother factor is what Tran said is a mental health crisis afflicting the country, which he said hasn't been discussed enough, particularly in areas with denser populations.\n\n\"Grieving takes on different flavors and manifestations, and the racist sentiments that we're seeing is in some ways the intersection of racism that we have always known about over the last century meeting people who are mentally rather unstable at this particular moment, and unleash the need to basically victimize others out of frustration,\" he said.\n\nEven in diverse cities like New York, the isolation and stress of the pandemic have often damaged the connections between groups of people, he said.\n\n\"In an environment of fear, mistrust, distrust and anxiety that we have been experiencing over the last year, any moments of conflict often get magnified,\" he said.\n\nWhen these connections occur, they must be \"meaningful contact with those who are seen as equals with each other\" to foster healthy relations between communities, he said. Often, communication with Asian Americans comes in interactions with delivery or food service workers, so people don't perceive them as equals, he said.\n\nAlthough it may feel like an impossible task, moving forward and emerging from the pandemic with less violence and hate will require unity and a fight against all forms of hatred and systemic racism across communities, Tran said.\n\n\"I think this is a very, very unique moment whereby I see a lot of need for those cross-race, cross-class relationships and coalitions. Across the spectrum, each of the racial minority groups is facing a different form of othering,\" Tran said. \"Some are more institutional. Others are more interpersonal — they are deeply connected, deeply linked to the ignorance and the hatred that are simmering or have been simmering underneath the surface.\"", "authors": ["Kimmy Yam", "Kimmy Yam Is A Reporter For Nbc Asian America."], "publish_date": "2021/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.policeforum.org/assets/COVIDPandemic.pdf", "title": "Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic: What Police Learned from ..."}, {"url": "https://www.splcenter.org/20110228/ku-klux-klan-history-racism", "title": "Ku Klux Klan: A History of Racism | Southern Poverty Law Center", "text": "The bare facts about the birth of the Ku Klux Klan and its revival half a century later are baffling to most people today. Little more than a year after it was founded, the secret society thundered across the war-torn South, sabotaging Reconstruction governments and imposing a reign of terror and violence that lasted three or four years. And then as rapidly as it had spread, the Klan faded into the history books. After World War I, a new version of the Klan sputtered to life and within a few years brought many parts of the nation under its paralyzing grip of racism and bloodshed. Then, having grown to be a major force for the second time, the Klan again receded into the background. This time it never quite disappeared, but it never again commanded such widespread support.\n\nToday, it seems incredible that an organization so violent, so opposed to the American principles of justice and equality, could twice in the nation’s history have held such power. How did the Ku Klux Klan — one of the nation’s first terrorist groups — so instantly seize the South in the aftermath of the Civil War? Why did it so quickly vanish? How could it have risen so rapidly to power in the 1920s and then so rapidly have lost that power? And why is this ghost of the Civil War still haunting America today with hatred, violence and sometimes death for its enemies and its own members?\n\nFrontier Justice\n\nThe answers do not lie on the surface of American history. They are deeper than the events of the turbulent 1960s, the parades and cross burnings and lynching’s of the 1920s, beyond even the Reconstruction era and the Civil War. The story begins, really, on the frontier, where successive generations of Americans learned hard lessons about survival. Those lessons produced some of the qualities of life for which the nation is most admired — fierce individualism, enterprising inventiveness, and the freedom to be whatever a person wants and to go wherever a new road leads.\n\nBut the frontier spirit included other traits as well, and one was a stubborn insistence on the prerogative of “frontier justice” — an instant, private, very personal and often violent method of settling differences without involving lawyers or courts. As the frontier was tamed and churches, schools and courthouses replaced log trading posts, settlers substituted law and order for the older brand of private justice. But there were always those who did not accept the change. The quest for personal justice or revenge became a key motivation for many who later rode with the Ku Klux Klan, especially among those who were poor and uneducated.\n\nNight Patrols\n\nA more obvious explanation of the South’s widespread acceptance of the Klan is found in the institution of slavery. Freedom for slaves represented for many white Southerners a bitter defeat — a defeat not only of their armies in the field but of their economic and social way of life. It was an age old nightmare come true, for early in Southern life whites in general and plantation owners in particular had begun to view the large number of slaves living among them as a potential threat to their property and their lives.\n\nA series of bloody slave revolts in Virginia and other parts of the South resulted in the widespread practice of authorized night patrols composed of white men specially deputized for that purpose. White Southerners looked upon these night patrols as a civic duty, something akin to serving on a jury or in the militia. The mounted patrols, or regulators, as they were called, prowled Southern roads, enforcing the curfew for slaves, looking for runaways, and guarding rural areas against the threat of black uprisings. They were authorized by law to give a specific number of lashes to any violators they caught. The memory of these legal night riders and their whips was still fresh in the minds of both defeated Southerners and liberated blacks when the first Klansmen took to those same roads in 1866.\n\nAftermath of War\n\nAn even more immediate impetus for the Ku Klux Klan was the civil War itself and the reconstruction that followed. When robed Klansmen were at their peak of power, alarmed Northerners justifiably saw in the Klan an attempt of unrepentant confederates to win through terrorism what they had been unable to win on the battlefield. Such a simple view did not totally explain the Klan’s sway over the South, but there is little doubt that many a confederate veteran exchanged his rebel gray for the hoods and sheets of the Invisible Empire.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, there were the conditions Southerners were faced with immediately after the war. Their cities, plantations and farms were ruined; they were impoverished and often hungry; there was an occupation army in their midst; and Reconstruction governments threatened to usurp the traditional white ruling authority. In the first few months after the fighting ended, white Southerners had to contend with the losses of life, property and, in their eyes, honor. The time was ripe for the Ku Klux Klan to ride.\n\n\n\nLynchings were a common form of vigilante justice during the 19th century.\n\nMischief Turns Malicious\n\nRobert R. Lee’s surrender was not fully nine months past when six young ex-confederates met in a law office in December 1865 to form a secret club that they called the Ku Klux Klan. From that beginning in the little town of Pulaski, Tennessee, their club began to grow. Historians disagree on the intention of the six founders, but it is known that word quickly spread about a new organization whose members met in secret and rode with their faces hidden, who practiced elaborate rituals and initiation ceremonies.\n\nMuch of the Klan’s early reputation may have been based on almost frivolous mischief and tomfoolery. At first, a favorite Klan tactic had been for a white-sheeted Klansman wearing a ghoulish mask to ride up to a black family’s home at night and demand water. When the well bucket was offered, the Klansman would gulp it down and demand more, having actually poured the water through a rubber tube that flowed into a leather bottle concealed beneath his robe. After draining several buckets, the rider would exclaim that he had not had a drink since he died on the battlefield at Shiloh. He then galloped into the night, leaving the impression that ghosts of confederate dead were riding the countryside.\n\nThe presence of armed white men roving the countryside at night reminded many blacks of the pre-war slave patrols. The fact that Klansmen rode with their faces covered intensified blacks’ suspicion and fear. In time, the mischief turned to violence. Whippings were used first, but within months there were bloody clashes between Klansmen and blacks, Northerners who had come South, or Southern unionists. from the start, however, there was also a sinister side to the Klan.\n\n\n\nKlansmen were caught trying to lynch a carpetbagger in 1871.\n\nBlack Codes\n\nBy the time the six Klan founders met in December 1865, the opening phase of reconstruction was nearly complete. All 11 of the former rebel states had been rebuilt on astonishingly lenient terms which allowed many of the ex-confederate leaders to return to positions of power. Southern state legislatures began enacting laws that made it clear that the aristocrats who ran them intended to yield none of their pre-war power and dominance over poor whites and especially over blacks. These laws became known as the Black codes and in some cases amounted to a virtual re-enslavement of blacks.\n\nIn Louisiana, the Democratic convention resolved that “we hold this to be a Government of White People, made and to be perpetuated for the exclusive benefit of the White race, and ... that the people of African descent cannot be considered as citizens of the United States.” Mississippi and Florida, in particular, enacted vicious Black codes, other Southern states (except North Carolina) passed somewhat less severe versions, and President Andrew Johnson did nothing to prevent them from being enforced.\n\nThese laws and the hostility and violence that erupted against blacks and Union supporters in the South outraged Northerners who just a few months before had celebrated victory, not only over the Confederacy but its system of slavery as well. In protest of the defiant Black Codes, Congress refused to seat the new Southern senators and representatives when it reconvened in December 1865 after a long recess. At the moment the fledgling Klan was born in Pulaski, the stage was set for a showdown between Northerners determined not to be cheated out of the fruits of their victory and die-hard Southerners who refused to give up their supremacy over blacks.\n\nIronically, the increasingly violent activities of the Klan throughout 1866 helped prove the argument of Radical Republicans in the North, who wanted harsher measures taken against Southern governments as part of their program to force equal treatment for blacks. Partly as a result of news reports of Klan violence in the South, the radicals won overwhelming victories in the congressional elections of 1866. In early 1867, they made a fresh start at Reconstruction. In March 1867, congress overrode President Johnson’s veto and passed the Reconstruction Acts, which abolished the ex-confederate state governments and divided 10 of the 11 former rebel states into military districts. The military governors of these districts were charged with enrolling black voters and holding elections for new constitutional conventions in each of the 10 states, which led to the creation of the radical Reconstruction Southern governments.\n\nGhost Riders\n\nIn April 1867, a call went out for all known Ku Klux Klan chapters or dens to send representatives to Nashville, Tenn., for a meeting that would plan, among other things, the Klan response to the new Federal Reconstruction policy.\n\nThroughout the summer and fall, the Klan had steadily become more violent. Thousands of the white citizens of west Tennessee, northern Alabama and part of Georgia and Mississippi had by this time joined the Klan. Many now viewed the escalating violence with growing alarm — not necessarily because they had sympathy for the victims, but because the night riding was getting out of their control. Anyone could put on a sheet and a mask and ride into the night to commit assault, robbery, rape, arson or murder. The Klan was increasingly used as a cover for common crime or for personal revenge.\n\nThe Nashville Klan convention was called to grapple with these problems by creating a chain of command and deciding just what sort of organization the Klan would be. The meeting gave birth to the official philosophy of white supremacy as the fundamental creed of the Ku Klux Klan. Throughout the summer of 1867 the Invisible Empire changed, shedding the antics that had brought laughter during its parades and other public appearances, and instead taking on the full nature of a secret and powerful force with a sinister purpose.\n\nAll the now-familiar tactics of the Klan date from this period — the threats delivered to blacks, radicals and other enemies warning them to leave town; the night raids on individuals they singled out for rougher treatment; and the mass demonstrations of masked and robed Klansmen designed to cast their long shadow of fear over a troubled community.\n\nBy early 1868, stories about Klan activities were appearing in newspapers nationwide, and reconstruction governors realized they faced nothing less than an insurrection by a terrorist organization. Orders went out from state capitols and Union army headquarters during the early months of 1868 to suppress the Klan.\n\nInvisible Government\n\nBut it was too late. From middle Tennessee, the Klan quickly was established in nearby counties and then in North and South Carolina. In some counties the Klan became the de facto law, an invisible government that state officials could not control.\n\nWhen Tennessee Governor William G. Brownlow attempted to plant spies within the Klan, he found the organization knew as much about his efforts as he did. One Brownlow spy who tried to join the Klan was found strung up in a tree, his feet just barely touching the ground. Later another spy was stripped and mutilated, and a third was stuffed in a barrel in Nashville and rolled down a wharf and into the Cumberland River, where he drowned.\n\nWith the tacit sympathy and support of most white citizens often behind it, the Klan worked behind a veil that was impossible for Brownlow and other Reconstruction governors to pierce. But even though a large majority of white Southerners opposed the Radical state governments, not all of them approved of the hooded order’s brand of vigilante justice. During its first year, the Klan’s public marches and parades were sometimes hooted and jeered at by townspeople who looked upon them as a joke. Later, when the Klan began to use guns and whips to make its point, some white newspaper editors, ministers and other civic leaders spoke out against the violence.\n\nBut in the late 1860s, white Southern voices against the Klan were in the minority. One of the Klan’s greatest strengths during this period was the large number of editors, ministers, former Confederate officers and political leaders who hid behind its sheets and guided its actions. Among them, none was more widely respected in the South than the Klan’s reputed leader, General Nathan Bedford Forrest, a legendary Confederate cavalry officer who settled in Tennessee and apparently joined the Klan fairly soon after it began to make a name for itself. Forrest became the Klan’s first imperial wizard, and in 1867 and 1868 there is little doubt that he was its chief missionary, traveling over the South, establishing new chapters and quietly advising its new members.\n\nThe ugly side of the Ku Klux Klan, the mutilations and floggings, lynching’s and shootings, began to spread across the South in 1868, and any words of caution that may have been expressed at the Nashville meeting were submerged beneath a stream of bloody deeds.\n\nThe KKK’s First Death\n\nAs the violence escalated, it turned to general lawlessness, and some Klan groups even began fighting each other. In Nashville, a gang of outlaws who adopted the Klan disguise came to be known as the Black Ku Klux Klan. For several months middle Tennessee was plagued by a guerrilla war between the real and bogus Klan’s.\n\nThe Klan was also coming under increased attack by Congress and the Reconstruction state governments. The leaders of the Klan thus realized that the order’s end was at hand, at least as any sort of organized force to serve their interests. It is widely believed that Forrest ordered the Klan disbanded in January 1869, but the surviving document is rather ambiguous. (Some historians think Forrest’s “order” was just a trick so he could deny responsibility or knowledge of Klan atrocities.)\n\nWhatever the actual date, it is clear that as an organized, cohesive body across the South, the Ku Klux Klan had ceased to exist by the end of 1869.\n\nThat did not end the violence, however, and as atrocities became more widespread, Radical legislatures throughout the region began to pass very restrictive laws, impose martial law in some Klan dominated counties, and actively hunt Klan leaders. In 1871, Congress held hearings on the Klan and passed a harsh anti-Klan law modeled after a North Carolina statute. Under the new federal law, Southerners lost their jurisdiction over the crimes of assault, robbery and murder, and the president was authorized to declare martial law and suspend the writ of habeas corpus. Night riding and the wearing of masks were expressly prohibited. Hundreds of Klansmen were arrested, but few actually went to prison.\n\nThe laws probably dampened the enthusiasm for the Ku Klux Klan, but they can hardly be credited with destroying the hooded order. By the mid-1870s, white Southerners didn’t need the Klan as much as before because they had by that time retaken control of most Southern state governments. Klan terror had proven very effective at keeping black voters away from the polls. Some black officeholders were hanged and many more were brutally beaten. White Southern Democrats won elections easily and then passed laws taking away the rights blacks had won during Reconstruction.\n\nThe result was an official system of segregation which was the law of the land for more than 80 years. This system was called “separate but equal,” which was half true — everything was separate, but nothing was equal.\n\nBorn Again\n\nDuring the last half of the 19th century, memories of the Ku Klux Klan’s brief grip on the South faded, and its bloody deeds were forgotten by many whites who were once in sympathy with its cause. On the national scene, two events served to set the stage for the Ku Klux Klan to be reborn early in the 20th century.\n\nThe first was massive immigration, bringing some 23 million people from Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Hungary, and Russia and a great cry of opposition from some Americans. The American Protective Association, organized in 1887, reflected the attitude of many Americans who believed that the nation was being swamped by alien people. This organization, a secret, oath bound group, was especially strong in the Middle West, where the reborn Ku Klux Klan would later draw much of its strength.\n\nThe other major event which prepared the ground for the Klan’s return was World War I, which had a wrenching, unsettling effect on the nation. On the European battlefields, white Americans again were exposed to unrestrained bloodshed while blacks served in the uniform of their country and saw open up before them a new world. Back at home, Americans learned suspicion, hatred and distrust of anything alien, a sentiment which led to the rejection of President Woodrow Wilson’s League of Nations.\n\nIn the South, yet another series of events occurred which helped breathe life into the Klan several decades later. In the 1890s, an agrarian Populist movement tried to build a coalition of blacks and poor whites against the mill owners, large landholders and conservative elite of the Old South. The aristocracy responded with the old cry of white supremacy and the manipulation of black votes. As a result, the Populists were substantially turned back in every Deep South state except Georgia and North Carolina. A feeling spread across the South, shared by both the aristocracy and many poor whites, that blacks had to be frozen out of society.\n\nThe 1890s marked the beginning of efforts in the Deep South to deny political, social and economic power to blacks. Most segregation and disenfranchisement laws date from that period. It was also the beginning of a series of lynching of blacks by white mobs. The combination of legalized racism and the constant threat of violence eventually led to a major black migration to Northern cities.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2011/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-politics-violence/", "title": "Political violence in polarized U.S. at its worst since 1970s"}, {"url": "http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/cnr.html", "title": "CNN.com - Transcripts"}, {"url": "https://edsource.org/news-updates", "title": "California education news: What's the latest? | EdSource"}, {"url": "https://www.usccr.gov/files/pubs/2019/11-13-In-the-Name-of-Hate.pdf", "title": "In the Name of Hate: Examining the Federal Government's Role in ...", "text": "", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/13"}]}

And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.\n\nA summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.\n\nDespite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nIn addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.\n\ntoggle caption Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nWhat are the committee's main recommendations?\n\nCiting the 14th amendment, the committee recommended Trump should be barred from holding federal or state office ever again. They also recommend the creation of a \"formal mechanism\" to evaluate whether those who took part in the insurrection should be barred from holding future government office on federal and other levels. The committee also recommends that Congress should make stronger criminal penalties for those who obstruct a peaceful transfer of power, And they recommend federal penalties for those who threaten election workers. The committee's investigation found that many of the people who refused to be pushed into manipulating election results, including governors, secretaries of state, state legislators, state and local election officials, and frontline election workers, found themselves subjected to spamming, doxing, harassment, intimidation, and violent threats. Some of those threats were sexualized or racist in nature and targeted family members. The committee subpoenaed several individuals in the process of their investigation, but their authority to enforce those subpoenas is unclear. The committee recommends the creation of new legislation that would enforce House subpoenas in federal court. The committee also recommends more oversight over the Capitol Police. \"Congressional committees of jurisdiction should continue regular and rigorous oversight of the United States Capitol Police as it improves its planning, training, equipping, and intelligence processes and practices its critical incident response protocols,\" they write. They said there should be joint hearings with testimony from the Capitol Police Board.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhat else is in the report?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Samuel Corum/Getty Images Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n\nThe report is broken into eight sections: the former president's election lies and declarations of victory, Trump's efforts to \"find\" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.\n\nOther key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:\n\nTrump planned to declare victory regardless of the outcome. The committee lays out how Trump's plan to overturn the 2020 election was not spontaneous, but premeditated.\n\nTrump was aware of the risk of violence when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol. The report shows how extremist groups like the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys banded together for the insurrection. \"President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, DC on the same day the joint session of Congress was to meet. He then told that same mob to march on the US Capitol and 'fight.' They clearly got the message,\" the committee wrote.\n\nTrump was aware of violence at the Capitol for more than three hours before he agreed to intervene. The report calls this period of time \"187 minutes of dereliction,\" in which they say Trump drank Diet Coke, put off advice from advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, and watched Fox News during the insurrection. The committee laid out a timeline of what happened leading up to and during those three hours, which entailed increasing tension between Trump and Vice President Pence and Trump himself attempting to go to the Capitol to join his supporters.\n\nTop aides to the president were aware that election fraud investigations would not change the election outcome. The committee argues that Trump and his allies not only lied about election fraud, but ripped-off their supporters by asking for money for lawsuits to fight the election results.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nYou can read more on NPR's coverage of the committee's public hearings here.\n\nWhat happens now that the report is out?\n\nWhat will come of the committee's recommendations is unclear.

Gov. John Fetterman (D) in a pivotal battleground in the fight for control of the Senate. The race has been stuck in limbo for weeks, as Oz’s razor-thin lead triggered a recount and as Fetterman — a liberal candidate who easily won the Democratic nomination — recovers from a stroke that sidelined him just before the primary.\n\nMcCormick said Friday that he concluded he would not be able to make up the deficit between him and Oz after 17 days of “making sure that every Republican vote was counted.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It’s now clear to me, with the recount largely complete, that we have a nominee,” he said, noting that he called Oz earlier in the day to congratulate him.\n\nMehmet Oz spoke to supporters on May 17 when results were too close to call in his race for the Republican nomination for one of Pennsylvania's Senate seats. (Video: Reuters)\n\nOz tweeted Friday evening that he “received a gracious phone call” from McCormick and said that with the primary over, they would ensure the Senate seat “does not fall into the hands of the radical left.”\n\nDemocrats are defending a narrow Senate majority in this year’s midterm elections. Pennsylvania, a battleground state where Republican Sen. Patrick J. Toomey is retiring, is seen as a critical front in the fight for control of the upper chamber of Congress.\n\nThe Republican primary, in which Trump endorsed Oz, was also a high-profile test of the former president’s influence on GOP voters. His record has been mixed so far this primary season, with his endorsed candidate suffering recent gubernatorial primary defeats in Georgia, Nebraska and Idaho to go along with Senate victories by his picks in Ohio, North Carolina and now Pennsylvania.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight after the May 17 primary, Trump had moved to baselessly discredit the then too-close-to-call Republican primary in Pennsylvania, urging Oz to declare victory before the vote tally was finished and seeking to raise concerns about mail-in ballots without presenting any evidence for his claims. Oz previously called himself the “presumptive” winner.\n\nTrump’s April endorsement boosted Oz despite misgivings from others in the GOP, who questioned the doctor’s record as conservative and highlighted his dual citizenship in the United States and Turkey. Oz has promised to renounce his Turkish citizenship if he is elected.\n\nTrump’s first pick in the Pennsylvania Senate race, Republican Sean Parnell, ended his campaign in 2021 amid domestic abuse allegations.\n\nWhile Trump’s support has been key in some Republican primaries, it remains to be seen how heavily Republicans will rally around his endorsed candidates. Some pre-primary polling found that many Republican voters had a negative opinion of Oz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcCormick emphasized the high stakes of the Senate race Friday and relayed to supporters that he told Oz, “What I always said to you — that I will do my part to try to unite Republicans and Pennsylvanians behind his candidacy.”\n\nDemocrats are already seeking to use Republican candidates’ ties to Trump against them in some key general-election races, including in Pennsylvania. President Biden’s low approval ratings and concerns about inflation have created major head winds for Democrats in the midterms and they are seeking ways to overcome those obstacles.\n\nOz’s opponents have highlighted his history of dispensing questionable medical advice on “The Dr. Oz Show.” Patrick Burgwinkle, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, denounced Oz in a statement Friday as “a fraud and a scam artist who will do, say, and sell anything to help himself — no matter who gets hurt.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAttacking Oz as a “self-serving millionaire,” Burgwinkle cast Oz as “a different, more dangerous kind of Republican” with extreme views on abortion and support for Trump’s relentless false claims that his 2020 election loss was marred by fraud. At a debate in April, Oz said “we cannot move on” from the 2020 race.\n\nFetterman on Friday said he “almost died” last month after his stroke and revealed in a statement that his condition was far more serious than his campaign had previously indicated. He said he should have taken medication prescribed for him in 2017.\n\nResponding to Fetterman’s health scare last month, Oz noted his work as a heart doctor.\n\n“I have cared for atrial fibrillation patients and witnessed the miracles of modern medicine in the treatment of strokes, so I am thankful that you received care so quickly,” he tweeted. “My whole family is praying for your speedy recovery.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOz led McCormick by 947 votes out of more than 1.3 million when the state’s top elections official ordered a statewide recount last month. Counties had until June 7 to recount ballots and until June 8 to convey their findings to the secretary of state.\n\nMcCormick’s campaign had hoped that challenged mail-in ballots might help close the gap.

State law requires an automatic recount if the margin of victory is within 0.5 percentage points.\n\n“Unfortunately, we’re not going to have resolution tonight,” McCormick predicted in remarks to his supporters, asserting that mail-in votes tabulated later Wednesday would seal his victory.\n\nOz also urged patience when he addressed supporters.\n\n“When all the votes are tallied,” he said late Tuesday, “I am confident we will win.”\n\nThe winner will face Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, the Democratic nominee, who was hospitalized in the final days of the campaign after he had a stroke.\n\nThe state secretary of state’s office indicated in a statement that it could take “a few days” to report unofficial results.\n\n“Ahead of the primary, more than 900,000 applications for mail-in and absentee ballots were requested,” the statement said. “We expect to have unofficial results within a few days. Given the possibility of recounts and the need for official certifications, it is unlikely that final results in all races will be available tonight.”\n\nIn the race for governor, state Sen. Doug Mastriano, known for advancing debunked claims that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, has won the GOP primary, NBC News projects.\n\nMastriano had been leading in polls when he scored a last-minute endorsement from Trump over the weekend. He will face state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, the Democratic nominee, in the general election.\n\nFollow live results on NBCNews.com.\n\nTrump's endorsement record was mixed Tuesday, and it could look worse if Oz can't hold on.\n\nIn North Carolina, Trump-endorsed Rep. Ted Budd won the GOP Senate primary and will face Democrat Cheri Beasley, the former chief justice of the state Supreme Court, in the general election, NBC News projected. But embattled Rep. Madison Cawthorn, whom Trump supported, lost a tough primary. And in Idaho, Gov. Brad Little survived a Trump-backed primary challenge from his own lieutenant governor, Janice McGeachin.\n\nBut the brightest spotlight Tuesday was on Pennsylvania, where after months of vitriol and tens of millions of dollars’ worth of TV ads, results could give the most clarity about the future of the Republican Party and Trump's hold over it.\n\nIn the battle for the nomination to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, Oz found himself in a three-way fight. He and McCormick bombarded the state’s airwaves with commercials. Polls had shown Kathy Barnette — a conservative commentator who has spent far less money and would be the first woman and the first Black candidate to win a Senate seat in Pennsylvania — surging late, although she ended up trailing Oz and McCormick on Election Day.\n\nIn the GOP race for governor, Mastriano had led in polls, and former U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta had tried to consolidate support among Republicans who argued that Mastriano is too extreme to be elected this fall. But Trump's late endorsement most likely fortified Mastriano against such efforts to stop him.\n\nMastriano and Barnette, who campaigned as a tandem, both traveled to Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, to protest President Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory over Trump. Both also have denied that they participated in the riot that breached the Capitol that day.\n\n“I feel about Jan. 6 the way the left feels about the summer of 2020, when you have Black Lives Matter and ‘antifa’ and other groups out there looting and robbing and everyone was calling it mostly peaceful protests,” Barnette said in an interview this week.\n\nThere was less suspense on the Democratic side Tuesday. Fetterman had held a sizable lead in polls of the Senate race, although his stroke kept him off the campaign trail in the final days and away from his victory party.\n\nShapiro was unopposed in his bid for the Democratic nomination for governor. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf is term-limited.\n\n\"Pennsylvanians need a governor who can meet this moment, but Republicans just nominated a dangerous extremist who wants to take away our freedoms,\" Shapiro, who also had to skip a victory party Tuesday after he tested positive for Covid, said in a statement Tuesday night. \"The contrast in this election could not be clearer — Doug Mastriano wants to ban abortion without exceptions, restrict the right to vote and spread conspiracy theories, and destroy the union way of life for hard working Pennsylvanians.\"\n\nPrimaries in North Carolina, Idaho, Kentucky, Oregon\n\nThe GOP Senate primary in North Carolina, where Republican incumbent Richard Burr isn't seeking re-election, had particularly high stakes. Trump endorsed Budd over former Gov. Pat McCrory. Budd also had the backing of the Club for Growth, a big-spending conservative group that split with Trump in this month’s rowdy Senate primary in Ohio, as well as in Pennsylvania, where it was behind Barnette.\n\nCawthorn, meanwhile, conceded to state Sen. Chuck Edwards, ending his bid for re-election. Cawthorn has been a vocal supporter of Trump and was seen as a rising star in that wing of the Republican Party.\n\nElsewhere, in contests that tested the mood in the Democratic Party more than a year into Biden’s presidency, several left-wing congressional candidates flamed out after they faced late barrages of attacks from moderate Democratic and pro-Israel super PACs.\n\nNational progressives decided this year to focus on Democratic-leaning congressional districts where no incumbents were on the ballot, but left-wing candidates Tuesday ended up losing by wide margins in two North Carolina districts and one in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe left still has a chance to notch a victory in a Pittsburgh congressional district, where Bernie Sanders-backed Summer Lee is running neck and neck with Steve Irwin, who is supported by retiring Rep. Mike Doyle. And they could still oust moderate Rep. Kurt Schrader in Oregon, where results are expected to take some time to be finalized.\n\nNational Democrats backed Schrader, while the local party supported progressive challenger Jamie McLeod-Skinner, arguing that Schrader isn't a real incumbent because the heavily redrawn district is now made up mostly of new voters.\n\nIn a crowded primary in the neighboring 6th District, a PAC linked to a cryptocurrency billionaire has spent $10.5 million — a virtually unheard-of sum, making it by far the most expensive House race of the cycle so far, according to Open Secrets, a nonprofit organization that tracks campaign finance data.\n\nBut it was Pennsylvania — with its chaotic and Trumpy primaries and swing-state status — that commanded most of the national attention. The Senate race is expected to be one of the most expensive in the battle for control of the chamber this fall. The two parties have a 50-50 split in the chamber, with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as a tiebreaking vote for Democrats.\n\nTrump inserted himself into the Senate race early, endorsing Army veteran Sean Parnell, an unsuccessful congressional candidate in 2020. But Parnell dropped out last fall after he lost a child custody dispute that included allegations of abuse, which he denied.\n\nOz and McCormick quickly jumped into the race. And McCormick, whose hedge fund history clashed with Trump’s economic nationalism and anti-China rhetoric, quickly surrounded himself with high-level veterans of Trump's White House and campaigns. McCormick’s wife, Dina Powell, served in the Trump administration and was featured prominently in her husband’s campaign ads.\n\nOz’s dual citizenship in Turkey and the occasionally liberal positions he advanced before he entered politics became fodder for McCormick and other rivals. Oz has vowed to renounce his Turkish citizenship if he wins the Senate race. And two influential champions helped him score Trump’s endorsement: former first lady Melania Trump and Fox News host Sean Hannity.\n\nBarnette, meanwhile, was perhaps best known for her unsuccessful 2020 congressional bid in the Philadelphia suburbs — a landslide loss that she baselessly attributed to voter fraud.\n\nShe stood out, however, at candidate forums and debates, earning free media coverage that offset the fact that Oz and McCormick were far outspending her on TV. And Barnette’s personal story — she speaks often about how she was conceived when her mother, then 11 years old, was raped — has resonated on the right at a time when the Supreme Court might soon overturn the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nOn the Democratic side, the populist Fetterman had long outpolled centrist U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb and state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who would have been the state's first openly gay and first Black senator. Fetterman has built a national profile through his support for legal recreational marijuana and LGBTQ rights while eschewing labels like \"progressive\" and pushing back against comparisons with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the democratic socialist he has aligned with in the past.\n\nLamb and Kenyatta both criticized Fetterman for an incident in 2013, when he pulled a shotgun on a Black jogger after he heard what he thought was gunfire and detained the man until police arrived. Fetterman, who is white and was the mayor of the Pittsburgh-area borough of Braddock at the time, has said he couldn't tell the man's race. The jogger was unarmed.\n\nThe attacks from Lamb and Kenyatta didn't harm Fetterman in a primary that polls showed him leading from the start.\n\n\"Democrats need to be unequivocally united in our defense of this democracy, and we will be,\" Lamb said in an emailed concession statement late Tuesday. \"John’s vote in the Senate is essential to protect this democracy, and he will have my vote in November. I will do everything I can to help Democrats win.\"", "authors": ["Https", "Media-Cldnry.S-Nbcnews.Com Image Upload Newscms", "Henry J.

Gov. John Fetterman.\n\n“We spent the last 17 days making sure every Republican vote was counted,” Mr. McCormick said in an appearance in Harrisburg with supporters on Friday evening. “But it’s now clear to me that with the recount largely complete, that we have a nominee.

Bob Casey and Republican Dave McCormick are officially set to face off in Pennsylvania’s high-stakes Senate battle this fall after winning their uncontested primaries on Tuesday.\n\nCasey, a three-term incumbent, and McCormick, who rallied the Pennsylvania GOP establishment behind his candidacy after announcing his bid last year, will now sprint toward the November election in one of the most bitterly contested, expensive Senate races in the country. The race is among a handful that could tip the balance of power in Congress’ upper chamber.\n\n“Pennsylvania deserves better than Bob Casey,” McCormick said during a victory speech on Tuesday. “At every single time where he could’ve been a leader instead of a follower, he’s chosen to be a follower.”\n\nFor McCormick, a hedge fund executive and former official in President George W. Bush’s Treasury Department, his 2024 run comes on the heels of a failed 2022 bid against celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, who narrowly defeated him in a Republican primary with former President Donald Trump’s backing. Oz went on to lose to Democrat John Fetterman in the general election.\n\nThis time around, McCormick has the support of Trump, as well as GOP leaders across Pennsylvania.\n\n“It’s a big day in Pennsylvania and we hope the people get out there and vote,” Trump said outside his criminal hush money trial in New York on Tuesday. “It’s important to vote to let them know that we’re coming on November 5th. We’re coming big. Today’s preliminary but still it’s very important and maybe they’ll think also about the very good person who’s running for the Senate in Pennsylvania, Dave McCormick.”\n\nBut even with a unified GOP behind him, McCormick faces an uphill battle. Republicans have lost race after race in the Keystone State following Trump’s shocking upset victory there in 2016. And Casey, the son of the state’s former governor, often polls ahead of President Joe Biden in the state.\n\n“Oh, the guy from Connecticut?” Fetterman told NBC News of McCormick, who Democrats have lambasted for maintaining a Connecticut residence. “He loves Connecticut and he loves working and investing in Chinese companies. And I don’t think that’s a winner in Pennsylvania, but I guess we’re going to find out. Bob Casey is going to smoke him.”\n\nPresidential primary protest votes\n\nThe top of the ticket in Pennsylvania on Tuesday lacked drama, as not only were both Casey and McCormick running unopposed, but the presidential primary amounted to a formality as well, with both Trump and Biden having already clinched their party’s nominations. NBC News projected that both men would win their party’s primaries in Pennsylvania.\n\nBut there was intrigue beneath the surface, as voters on both sides had the chance to submit protest votes on Tuesday. There was an organized effort to get Democratic voters to write in “uncommitted” on their presidential primary ballots to express opposition to Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. And Nikki Haley, who dropped out of the race in early March, still appeared on the Republican ballot.\n\nInitial vote totals looked like Trump faced a more substantial protest vote than Biden. With roughly 95% of the expected vote counted on Wednesday morning, about 16% of Republican primary voters backed Haley — more than 150,000 in total. Pennsylvania has a closed primary system, so only registered Republicans could vote in that contest, unlike earlier primaries where Democrats and independents had a chance to cast ballots.\n\nBut on the Democratic side, with 96% of the expected vote counted on Wednesday, about 5% went to write-ins. Biden, meanwhile, garnered about 88% of the vote while Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., got about 6% support after ending his candidacy last month. Not all counties tabulate write-in votes on election night, so the full scope of any write-in campaign might not be clear until all votes are counted. Still, more than 55,000 write-in votes were cast.\n\nOrganizers backing an “uncommitted” vote protesting Biden's handling of the war between Israel and Hamas hoped to garner at least 40,000 write-in votes in their campaign. It’s unclear how many write-in votes were associated with the effort.\n\nThe Democratic primary is also only open to registered party members.\n\nIn total, more than 163,000 Republican primary voters either voted for Haley or cast write-in votes. On the Democratic side, at least 123,000 voters chose Phillips or submitted a write-in.\n\nBiden eclipsed former President Barack Obama's vote total in the 2012 Democratic primary, the last time an incumbent Democrat ran for reelection. Biden won more than 926,000 votes in this year's primary, compared to about 616,000 for Obama in 2012. That year, about 19,000 Democratic primary voters cast write-in votes.\n\nBiden's raw vote total looks to have exceeded Trump's, who as of Wednesday morning had about 788,000 votes for him counted. In Pennsylvania's 2020 GOP primary, when Trump was an incumbent and did not face a serious primary challenge, he won just north of 1 million votes.\n\nWith votes still being counted, Democrats looked to have an edge about about 100,000 voters turn out in their primary compared to the GOP contest. A similar number of votes remain to be counted in each race.\n\nThe battle for the House\n\nFurther down the ballot, there were a few races of significant intrigue. Chief among them was a House Democratic primary in the Pittsburgh area, where NBC News projects Rep. Summer Lee defeated Edgewood Borough Council member Bhavini Patel.\n\nThe race tested the power of sentiment over the war in Gaza, as Lee is the first among the progressive lawmakers who have been staunch critics of the Israeli war effort to face down a primary. And part of her district includes a prominent historically Jewish neighborhood, Squirrel Hill, that was home to the worst antisemitic attack in U.S. history in 2018.\n\nBut Lee, a member of the “Squad” along with fellow progressives such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the House, was widely seen as a favorite ahead of Tuesday’s contest, as pro-Israel groups that spent against her in her initial 2022 primary opted against doing so this time.\n\nLee’s opponent, Bhavini Patel, was boosted by an outside expenditure from GOP megadonor Jeffrey Yass. Patel denounced Yass, but Lee and allies portrayed her as a conservative Democrat because of Yass’ involvement. Pennsylvania’s 12th District is solidly Democratic.\n\nIn eastern Pennsylvania, another House primary shaped up as one of the more important battles of the night as Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick fought off a GOP primary challenge from anti-abortion-rights activist Mark Houck. It wasn't the first time Fitzpatrick, a moderate Republican and former FBI agent, has faced a challenge from the right in the 1st District, which Biden carried in 2020.\n\nFitzpatrick will now face Democrat Ashley Ehasz, an Army veteran whom he defeated by 10 points in 2022, again this fall.\n\nSeveral general election matchups in competitive House races were also set in Pennsylvania, as Republicans nationally are aiming to hold onto a razor-thin majority in the lower chamber this year.\n\nIn the 7th District north of Philadelphia, state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie won the GOP primary, advancing to the what's expected to be a hotly contested general election against Democratic Rep. Susan Wild. Wild won a third term in 2022 by just 2 points after Biden won her district by less than 1 point in 2020.\n\nIn the 10th District, which includes Harrisburg, former local TV news anchor Janelle Stelson won a six-way Democratic primary to take on GOP Rep. Scott Perry, the former chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus who was involved in Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nStelson had the support of EMILY’s List, a group that backs female candidates who support abortion rights. Trump carried the district by 4 points in 2020.\n\nElsewhere, Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright will face Republican businessman Rob Bresnahan in the Scranton-area 8th District, which Trump carried four years ago. And Democratic Rep. Chris Deluzio will take on GOP state Rep.

Poehler said she could get him to return, prompting Biden to enter to “Hail to the Chief.”\n\n“It’s good to be back,” Biden told Meyers. “Why haven’t you invited me earlier?”\n\nGoing into this year’s presidential election, Biden is seeking additional ways to reach out to voters, having largely avoided White House press conferences and on-the-record sit-downs with text reporters. Biden also skipped the traditional pre-Super Bowl presidential interview.\n\nMeyers quizzed Biden about a conspiracy theory spread among some conservatives on social media that Swift and Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce are part of an elaborate plot to help Democrats win the November election.\n\n“I have you on the hotspot here,” Meyers asked. “Can you confirm or deny that there is an active conspiracy between you and Miss Swift?”\n\n“Where are you getting this information, it’s classified,” Biden retorted, adding that Swift endorsed him for president in 2020. Meyers followed up to ask if she would endorse Biden again, prompting the president to laughingly add, “I told you it’s classified.”\n\nMeyers also asked Biden what he thought of the “Dark Brandon” meme, which features Biden with lasers for eyes. Biden quipped, “I resent the hell out of it,” then donned a pair of his signature aviator sunglasses. The meme, which first surfaced in conservative circles, has been embraced by Biden’s campaign and supporters, and is a top driver of sales in his campaign merchandise.\n\nBiden, at 81 the oldest-ever U.S. leader, also addressed concerns about his age, saying, “You got to take a look at the other guy, he’s about as old as I am, but he can’t remember his wife’s name.”\n\nIt was an apparent reference to Donald Trump’s appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside of Washington last weekend, when the former president praised his wife Melania and also referenced “Mercedes” — Mercedes Schlapp, his former aide who helps run the group and was in the audience. Some on social media, as well as Meyers in his monologue, suggested that Trump had used the wrong name for his wife.\n\nBiden added that what truly matters is “how old your ideas are” and proceeded to blast Trump and Republicans for supporting rolling back abortion access and other policies that have been “solid American positions” for decades.\n\nThe president also criticized Trump for praising those who participated in the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, and for pledging to pardon those who assaulted police officers and tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“That’s what happens in Eastern European countries,” Biden said. “That’s not what happens in America.”\n\nMeyers has taken frequent jabs at Trump, and devoted much of his show before Biden’s appearance to criticizing the former president and Republicans over a controversial court ruling in Alabama that upended in vitro fertilization treatment in the state.\n\nPresident Joe Biden eats ice cream at Van Leeuwen Ice Cream Monday, Feb. 26, 2024, in New York, as Seth Meyers watches.

John Fetterman saying those who criticize Biden might as well be supporting Trump.\n\n“Criticizing or mocking our leaders is a healthy thing in a democracy,” Meyers said. “I mean, Joe Biden seems to be able to take a joke. We here at ‘Late Night’ make jokes about him all the time.”\n\nDuring his first three years as president, Biden has given 33 news conferences, the fewest in that time span since Ronald Reagan, according to Martha Kumar, a Towson University professor emeritus and expert on presidents and the press. Biden has given just 86 interviews, significantly fewer than the 422 given by Barack Obama during his first three years.\n\nAfter recording the interview, Biden stopped off for some mint chip ice cream from Van Leeuwen, with Meyers joining him and getting the honeycomb flavor.

If we do the same thing they do, our democracy will literally be in jeopardy.”\n\nKimmel pushed back a bit at this assertion saying, “it’s like you’re playing Monopoly with somebody who won’t pass ‘Go’ and won’t follow any of the rules.”\n\n“How do you ever make any progress if they’re not following the rules?” Kimmel asked.\n\nBiden then interjected.\n\n“You got to send them to jail,” he said, referencing the square in the board game.\n\nPresident Joe Biden Visits Jimmy Kimmel Live\n\nBiden and Kimmel also spoke about inflation, which Biden called “the bane of our existence.” The President mentioned that it’s mostly in food and gasoline.\n\n“That’s what kills you because it’s a little billboard telling everyone how expensive everything is,” Kimmel said. “If Donald Trump leaves one of those Sharpies over for you, you could maybe change the price on that, you know?”\n\nKimmel first announced Biden’s appearance via Twitter (TWTR) Sunday night, and the interview caused some commotion.\n\n“Last night we announced that our President, Joe Biden, would be stopping by,” Kimmel said on Monday’s show. “He will be here, which is nice, because it gives the gang at Fox News something to scream about all week.”\n\nKimmel then showed a clip of Fox Business host Dagen McDowell saying that the interview takes place in the “land of insanity in which we all live.”\n\n“Oh, I see. What I do is insane. You guys telling us we should arm P.E. teachers to protect kids. That makes sense,” he said.\n\nKimmel then used some late night language to make his point even further.\n\n“Tucker Carlson giving Vladmir Putin a reach around every other night, sane,” he said. “President on a late night talk show, insane. Got it.”\n\nKimmel’s evolution\n\nHaving Biden join Kimmel, in particular, may be a savvy move by the White House. Kimmel has used his platform to make emotional stands about issues core to progressives’ values, including Obamacare and gun control.\n\nIt’s quite the evolution for Kimmel who started his career as the raunchy host of Comedy Central’s “The Man Show” before writing songs about “f**king Ben Affleck” and reading Mean Tweets on the ABC late night show.\n\nBut Kimmel’s entry into the political world was not much of a choice for the comedian. Many of the issues that Kimmel has taken on are personal for him.\n\nKimmel passionately spoke about the health care debate following the birth of his son, Billy, who was born with a serious heart issue. As for gun reform, Kimmel broke down in tears after a mass shooting took place in Las Vegas, his hometown, in 2017.\n\nThe reason that Kimmel has been able to stand out as this late night voice of the people is because “Kimmel simply sounds like a regular guy making reasonable points,” according to Bill Carter, a CNN analyst who has written multiple books about late-night TV.\n\n“Probably more than any other current late-night host, Kimmel projects solid working-class and family values,” Carter said. “He seems to most viewers a guy who could share a beer and slice of pizza with anybody.”\n\nCarter added that when Kimmel is on “the edge of emotional breakdown over his fears for his newborn son, or the massacre of innocent people in his hometown,” it doesn’t come across to most viewers as “Hollywood activism.” Instead, “it comes across as human activism,” he wrote.\n\nBiden’s new strategy\n\nAs for Biden, the reason for the appearance is clear: it helps humanize him to voters and get his message across to millions.\n\nBiden and his advisers have been frustrated in recent months as their attempts to get the President’s message to break through to voters have been less than successful. CNN reported last week that the White House is looking for more opportunities to show off Biden’s personality outside of the staid set-piece speeches that have mostly marked their public relations strategy in the initial stage of his presidency, giving him little opportunity for the unscripted moments that have become a core part of his political identity over his long career.\n\nThe Kimmel appearance is a chance for him to show off the retail politician traits he’s honed during his more than 50 years in politics — traits he’s not often been able to use due to a lack of interaction with real voters driven first by the Covid-19 pandemic and then a series of crises that have kept him at the White House.\n\n– CNN’s Kyle Feldscher contributed to this report", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/06/08"}, {"url": "https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/joe-biden-jimmy-kimmel-live-guest-1235285265/", "title": "President Joe Biden to Appear on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!'", "text": "President Joe Biden will serve as a guest on Wednesday night’s broadcast of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on ABC, appearing in-person on the late night talk show for an interview at the production’s studio at L.A.’s El Capitan Entertainment Centre on Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nThe announcement was made on Sunday afternoon by Kimmel during the broadcast of “Jimmy Kimmel Live: NBA Finals Game Night” on ABC, which is part of the network’s broadcast of Game 2 of the NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and Golden State Warriors.\n\nPresident Biden’s conversation with Jimmy Kimmel will mark his first in-studio appearance on a late night talk show since being inaugurated in January 2021.

As promised, Amy Poehler—Meyers' good friend, former \"Weekend Update\" co-anchor, and his first-ever Late Night guest—made her return to the show.\n\nHow to Watch Watch Late Night with Seth Meyers on NBC weeknights at 12:35/11:35c and next day on Peacock.\n\nBut that wasn't the night's only full-circle moment: President Joe Biden, Meyers' other guest on his 2014 premiere episode, arrived in person at 30 Rockefeller Center to mark the occasion as well. After \"interrupting\" Poehler's interview, Biden spoke to Meyers about a range of topics, from concerns about his age to far-right conspiracies about Taylor Swift and why he's hopeful for America.\n\nRELATED: Late Night with Seth Meyers Celebrates 10 Years with First-Ever Guest Amy Poehler\n\nAhead of Biden's walk-on, Meyers and Poehler launched into a brief bit about how the Commander in Chief—who was Vice President at the time of his first appearance—actually couldn't make it that night.

It's classified!\" Biden joked, while reminding Meyers that Swift did endorse him in 2020. (Meanwhile, Poehler shared that the one conspiracy she knows to be true is that \"an octopus is an alien, and the bottom of the sea floor is actually the top of the earth.\" Seems legit!).\n\nBiden addresses concerns about his age vs \"the other guy\" on Late Night\n\nPresident Joe Biden Addresses Concerns Over His Age and Shares His 2024 Agenda\n\n\"Some classified documents recently leaked, and isn't a 'gotcha' show, but I do want to ask you about it: It says you are currently 81 years old,\" Meyers said.\n\n\"Who the hell told you that?!\" Biden joked. All jokes aside, Meyers pressed, how does Biden plan to address the \"real concern\" that voters have, according to polls?\n\n\"Well, a couple things. Number one, you got to take a look at the other guy,\" Biden said, meaning former president and presumptive 2024 Republican nominee Donald Trump, who turns 78 this year. \"He's about as old as I am, but he can't even remember his wife's name.\" (On February 24, some observers of a speech claimed that Trump struggled to remember his wife Melania's name before saying \"Mercedes\" instead.)\n\n\"Number two,\" Biden continued, \"It's about how old your ideas are. Look, I mean, this is a guy who wants to take us back. He wants to take us back on Roe v Wade. He wants to take us back on a whole range of issues that, for 50, 60 years, they've been solid American positions.\"\n\n\"Our democracy is at stake,\" Biden added. \"It literally is.\"\n\nWatch President Biden's 2024 interview with Seth Meyers above.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/2024/03/23/1240154160/trump-rally-2024-election", "title": "What happens at a 2024 Trump rally?

You just can't describe it verbally.\"\n\nAt 6:30 a.m. it was still dark in Rome, Ga. But people had been lined up for a long time already, still nearly 12 hours before Trump was set to take the stage at another of his rallies.\n\nSome had waited all night amid the crowd-control gates, in the bottom level of a downtown parking garage. At the very front of the line, Sharon Anderson waited under a blanket on a camp chair.\n\nShe told me this was her 50th rally. Why does she attend so many?\n\n\"I want to show my support for the best president in the history of this nation,\" she explained.\n\nAnderson and some friends were all wearing tops styled to look like baseball shirts, with a big \"47\" on the back (for Trump's quest to be the 47th president) and \"FRONT ROW JOES\" on the front. Those \"Joes\" are a team of Trump superfans who get right up front at rallies.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nI asked Anderson how she would describe a Trump rally to someone who has never been to one.\n\n\"Oh, it's very uplifting, encouraging, exciting,\" she said. \"You just can't describe it verbally.\"\n\nMany Americans won't share her experience — or her view — and will instead witness Trump events through viral clips of his at times violent, anti-democratic rhetoric — for example, his recent dehumanizing language about migrants and comments about a \"bloodbath\" should Joe Biden win a second term.\n\nAnd that's important. But nine years in, these surreal events say so much more about the continued Trump phenomenon.\n\nA Trump rally has the feel of an all-day pep rally mixed with a megachurch service — except with Trumpism as the religion. The rallies are places where a movement largely defined by grievance can be together, away from opponents — not to mention assertions that Trump lies and is harmful to democracy.\n\nThey are places to see that for many Americans, Trumpism isn't just about politics; it's a core part of their identities.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Elijah Nouvelage/AFP via Getty Images Elijah Nouvelage/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFamilies, fandoms, and 'FJB'\n\nFor the next hundred years, this is going to be talked about. And my kids will be able to say, 'Hey, I was there. My mom took me to that. I saw that man.'\"\n\nNot far away from Sharon — maybe 20th in line — Lauren Tucker waited. She and her mother traded off holding their place in line overnight. This would be her first rally.\n\n\"Everybody here, all the people that were in line before us, they have been so amazing all night long. And they told us exactly what to expect. They helped us get our little buttons and they've just been wonderful,\" Tucker exclaimed. \"It's almost like a little family.\"\n\nTucker is the mother of six, and her 6-year-old son played on a tablet next to her.\n\n\"It was very important for me to have my kids be here because this is something that, A, they're going to remember, and, B, this is going to be talked about for years,\" she said. \"For the next hundred years, this is going to be talked about. And my kids will be able to say, 'Hey, I was there. My mom took me to that. I saw that man.'\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTucker was wearing red white and blue eyeshadow and an American flag cowboy hat.\n\nAnd this is a hallmark of Trump rallies: people dress up for them in a way they don't for other politicians.\n\nMerch sellers like Amber Johnson add to a growing sea of Trumpwear. Johnson is a Trump supporter herself — she calls herself a \"Republican Mississippi hippie\" — and compares the rallies to rock concerts. She speaks from experience.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Elijah Nouvelage/AFP via Getty Images Elijah Nouvelage/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"It's kind of the same vibe. So I followed Dead & Company and Phish around all summer, and now I'm out here doing the same thing, but selling political merchandise,\" she said with a laugh.\n\nAnd this is one way to understand what makes Trump such a singular phenomenon. His fans aren't just out to hear a political message; they're participating in a fandom — a political version of Deadheads or Parrotheads.\n\nThen again, there's a combativeness at a Trump concert that doesn't exist at a Phish concert — or at a Biden event, for that matter.\n\nOne man nearby sold t-shirts printed with vulgar, sexually explicit statements about Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Nancy Pelosi. Among Johnson's tamer shirts was one that read, \"If you don't like Trump, then you probably won't like me, and I'm OK with that.\"\n\nAnother read \"FJB,\" where the JB stands for Joe Biden and the F is an expletive.\n\nCarli Godfrey is 16 and came with her grandmother, in matching t-shirts. She read the defiant phrase written across their chests: \"I'm still a Trump girl. I make no apologies.\"\n\nI asked Godfrey what that means – does she think people want her to make apologies? She answered that even in uberconservative northwest Georgia, her politics differ from some of her peers'.\n\n\"Being in high school, some people are like, 'Why are you doing that?'\" she said, referring to her Trump fandom. \"I mean, a lot of people — this is going to sound really sad, but a lot of people don't stand for [the] flag. But I do. I always will.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe grievance of the underdog\n\nWhat's so frustrating is that the leftist wing focuses so much on minorities that it feels like me as a white man, that I am the minority.\"\n\nThe aggressive merch suggests that wearers expect, even relish, opposition. And Trump rallies have perhaps a more confrontational feel than ever, amid his four indictments, and his insistence that he won in 2020. All the voters I asked about 2020 also think Trump won that election. He didn't.\n\nMidmorning, a few hundred deep into the line, Angie Patrick had just helped a friend wriggle into a new t-shirt reading \"God, Guns, and Trump\". Patrick said me she has her own way of fighting for the former president.\n\n\"I'm a digital warrior. That means sharing things that perhaps maybe the mainstream media doesn't necessarily share with the public,\" she explained.\n\nShe mentioned multiple conspiracy theories she believes in and said she had been kicked off of Twitter 31 times (pre-Elon Musk's tenure, that is).\n\nTo Patrick, Trump is beleaguered and bullied...but also massively powerful. It's a careful needle he has managed to thread with his followers.\n\n\"I think he's beaten the odds. And I like an underdog,\" she said. But she quickly added, \"although I don't think Trump is an underdog. I think he's definitely the front dog.\"\n\nA lot of Trump's supporters themselves feel like underdogs.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, people were taking their seats in the city arena. One of them, college student Zachary Wright, said he feels economically strapped, but also feels marginalized culturally.\n\n\"If the economy keeps on getting worse and worse and worse, then how much is it going to cost for my kids to get lunch? And not only that, what's so frustrating is that the leftist wing focuses so much on minorities that it feels like me as a white man, that I am the minority.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWe versus 'they'\n\nAll afternoon, people queued for concessions and restrooms, chatting with their fellow Trump disciples.\n\nBut the mood darkened as Trump's opening act took the stage — a run of right-wing politicians. Their message was that the Trump movement has an endless string of enemies outside the arena.\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene, for example, repeatedly referenced a nameless \"they.\"\n\n\"We said build the wall. And they were offended. We said back the blue and they were offended, right?\" she added, as the crowd started booing in agreement.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Danielle Kurtzleben/NPR Danielle Kurtzleben/NPR\n\nAt a Trump rally, even the rioters who attacked the capitol on Jan. 6 are recast as victims of anti-Trump forces.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" an announcer's deep voice boomed over dramatic music. \"Please rise for the horribly and unfairly treated January 6 hostages.\"\n\nLately, Trump takes the stage after a recording of the national anthem sung by those jailed for that attack. While Trump's indictment for his actions on Jan. 6 looms over his campaign, he also embraces that day. Indeed, he has said he plans to pardon many of the convicted rioters.\n\nTrump started speaking in Rome at around 6:00 p.m., about an hour late. He would remain on stage for nearly 2 hours — long even for a Trump rally speech.\n\nAs usual, the demonization of undocumented immigrants was a key focus and drew loud cheers.\n\n\"What Joe Biden has done on our border is a crime against humanity and the people of this nation for which he will never be forgiven. We're going to fix it. We're going to fix it fast. We're going to have the largest deportation in history,\" he said, to thunderous applause.\n\nEven when his particular wording doesn't make headlines, Trump's speeches are full of false — and sometimes strange — rhetoric about migrants.\n\n\"They always say suburban housewives, they want something that's very important: security,\" he told the crowd. \"They don't want illegal immigrants coming into our country. They don't want illegal immigrants knocking on their front door and saying, 'I'm going to use your kitchen, and I'm going to use your bedroom, and there's not a damn thing-' And that's the nice ones, okay?\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe speech went beyond immigration though, meandering toward many more of trump's grievances — yes, against Joe Biden, but also Fulton County, Ga., prosecutor Fani Willis, N.Y. Attorney General Letitia James, Megyn Kelly and Martha Stewart...to name a few.\n\nIn addition, he praised Hungarian autocrat Viktor Orban and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nAfter it all, the evening ended with a familiar benediction: \"We will make America great again.\"\n\nJust outside, Tynisha Williams said she had a great time. She added — paradoxically — she thinks Trump's divisiveness will unify the U.S.\n\n\"It's time for the kid gloves to be taken off,\" she said. \"You need to know the hard truth. And the hard truth is we need to come back together as a country. We need to get this country back together. And we got to unite. We gotta make this country great again, as simple as that.\"\n\nIt's not clear how Trump would unite the nation, however.

I think we need to move on with new leadership that can be trustworthy.\"\n\nGaetz also confirmed that he'll soon file a motion to vacate the speakership in an appearance on ABC News' \"This Week,\" after the Senate and House voted on Saturday night to pass a short-term bill to keep the government funded through Nov. 17.\n\nIn response to Gaetz's announcement, McCarthy said, “That’s nothing new. ... He’s tried to do that from the moment I ran for office. ... Yes, I’ll survive. You know, this is personal with Matt.”\n\nGaetz is “more interested in securing TV interviews than doing something,\" McCarthy added. “So be it, bring it on, let’s get over with it and let’s start governing.\"\n\nThe short-term funding bill authorizes additional disaster relief money and buys Congress more time to reach a funding agreement for the full year. However, it does not include aid to Ukraine. McCarthy removed the provision from the bipartisan Senate bill, saying it should be considered separately at a later date.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., speaks with Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., in the House chamber on Jan. 6, the day before McCarthy became speaker. Olivier Douliery / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nUnder the rules adopted earlier this year, any Republican lawmaker can call for a motion to vacate the speaker's chair, and the House would have to vote on it within two legislative days.\n\nIt's not clear that Gaetz has enough votes to oust McCarthy. He would need at least five Republican lawmakers to vote with him, if all Democrats were to also vote to remove him.\n\n“I don’t think he is worried about it,” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., said of McCarthy. “Because he doesn’t believe that there’s 218 people that are going to go to the floor and punish putting a bipartisan bill on the floor to keep the government open. ... I don’t see how anybody can square that.”\n\n“We can’t have five people out of 435 — I don’t know what percent that is — completely hijacking our chamber, and therefore hijack our government. The will of the people have to prevail in the United States,” he said Sunday in an interview. “Otherwise the system and the democracy don’t work.”\n\nRep. Larry Bucshon, R-Ind., slammed Gaetz’s plan and called him a \"charlatan.\"\n\n\"He is threatening to remove Speaker McCarthy using at least 200 Democrat votes. He has been reaching out to them for votes! Is the hypocrisy lost on anyone? At least 200 House Rs will be voting to support the Speaker, including me,\" the Indiana Republican wrote on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nBefore Congress passed the bill Saturday, McCarthy announced he would nix Republican demands for spending cuts and policy provisions on immigration in order to hold a quick House vote on a \"clean\" stopgap bill. His announcement came a day after a group of conservative rebels, led by Gaetz, blocked House Republicans’ short-term funding bill to keep the government open.\n\nMcCarthy said Saturday that the vote left him with no choice but to drop Republicans' demands.\n\nThe vote Friday by the 21 conservative rebels to scuttle House Republicans’ 30-day funding bill last week had left them without a plan to avert a shutdown. The rebels had demanded the House to pass all 12 appropriations bills with steep spending cuts, before negotiating funding with the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nThe Republicans who joined Gaetz last week in voting down McCarthy’s short-term funding bill included Reps. Andy Biggs, Eli Crane and Paul Gosar of Arizona; Lauren Boebert and Ken Buck, both of Colorado; Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia; Tim Burchett and Andy Ogles, both of Tennessee; Alex Mooney, who is running for Senate in West Virginia; Matt Rosendale, who is running for Senate in Montana; and Nancy Mace, who represents a swing district in South Carolina. All these lawmakers also voted against the continuing resolution that passed Saturday night.\n\nGaetz had threatened to move to oust McCarthy if he worked with Democrats to fund the government with a clean continuing resolution.\n\n“Speaker McCarthy made an agreement with House conservatives in January, and since then he has been in brazen, repeated, material breach of that agreement. This agreement that he made with Democrats, to really blow past a lot the spending guardrails we'd set up, is really the last straw,\" Gaetz said on \"State of the Union.\"\n\nHe also accused McCarthy of making a deal with Democrats to pass the CR without Ukraine funding. \"Then overnight I learned that Kevin McCarthy had a secret deal with Democrats on Ukraine,\" Gaetz said. \"So as he was baiting Republicans to vote for a continuing resolution without Ukraine money, saying that we were going to jam the Senate on Ukraine, he then turns around and makes a secret deal.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden, asked Sunday at a news conference at the White House whether he trusts McCarthy to keep his word about an agreement, said: “We just made one about Ukraine. So we’ll find out.”\n\nDuring the news conference, Biden would not comment on whether Democrats should support McCarthy's speakership, reassured Americans that Ukraine funding would be passed and said he hopes \"this experience for the speaker has been one of a personal revelation.”\n\nA spokesperson for McCarthy said funding for Ukraine should go side by side with immigration measures.\n\n“Speaker McCarthy has been clear and consistent: we have an obligation to fix the crisis at the border and to ensure any request for further aid to Ukraine is matched with a sound strategy and accountability,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “The House will continue to discuss these challenges in the weeks to come.”\n\nGaetz expressed some confidence when he was asked how many Republicans he thinks will support his motion to vacate, which requires 218 votes to pass.\n\n“Well, enough so that when you host this show next week, if Kevin McCarthy is still the speaker of the House, he will be serving at the pleasure of the Democrats. He will be working for the Democrats,” he told CNN's Jake Tapper. “The only way Kevin McCarthy is speaker of the House at the end of this coming week is if Democrats bail him out.”\n\nMcCarthy last month dared his detractors to file the “motion to vacate” the speaker’s chair and try to remove him during a closed-door House GOP meeting. During the meeting, McCarthy told House Republicans, “If you want to file a motion to vacate, then file the f---ing motion,” according to two sources in the room who confirmed the comments to NBC News.\n\nMcCarthy’s remarks came in response to members, including Gaetz, who threatened to force him out of the speakership if he doesn’t follow through with their demands, such as putting certain bills on the floor and not passing a stopgap bill to prevent a government shutdown at the end of the month.\n\nHouse Ways and Committee Chair Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., on Sunday called Gaetz’s effort to boot McCarthy from speakership a “waste of time\" in an interview on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who served as House speaker before McCarthy assumed the role, echoed Smith's remarks.\n\n“You’re wasting your time on that guy because he has no sway in the House of Representatives, except to get on TV and raise money on the internet,” Pelosi said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said she would “absolutely” vote for a motion to vacate while making clear that she would not vote for a Republican to replace McCarthy as speaker.\n\n“My vote at the beginning of this term for speaker of the House was for Hakeem Jeffries, and I do not intend on voting for a Republican s speaker of the House,” Ocasio-Cortez said on “State of the Union.”\n\n“But I believe that it’s up to the Republican conference to determine their own leadership and deal with their own problems,” she added. “But it’s not up to Democrats to save Republicans, from themselves especially.”\n\nShe said that Democrats may be open to negotiating with McCarthy if he's at risk of losing his speakership, but that she doesn’t believe they would “give up votes for free.”\n\nCORRECTION (Oct. 1, 2023, 8:07 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the name of the show on which House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith was interviewed.

On these two matters he moved quickly and decisively.\n\nDuring the campaign, Jackson had charged the Adams bureaucracy with fraud and with working against his election. As President, he initiated sweeping removals among highranking government officials—Washington bureau chiefs, land and customs officers, and federal marshals and attorneys. Jackson claimed to be purging the corruption, laxity, and arrogance that came with long tenure, and restoring the opportunity for government service to the citizenry at large through \"rotation in office.\" But haste and gullibility did much to confuse his purpose.\n\nUnder the guise of reform, many offices were doled out as rewards for political services. Newspaper editors who had championed Jackson's cause, some of them very unsavory characters, came in for special favor. His most appalling appointee was an old army comrade and political sycophant named Samuel Swartwout. Against all advice, Jackson made him collector of the New York City customhouse, where the government collected nearly half its annual revenue. In 1838, Swartwout absconded with more than $1 million, a staggering sum for that day. Jackson denied that political criteria motivated his appointments, claiming honesty and efficiency as his only goals. Yet he accepted an officeholder's support for Adams as evidence of unfitness, and in choosing replacements he relied exclusively on recommendations from his own partisans. A Jackson senator from New York, William L. Marcy, defended Jackson's removals by proclaiming frankly in 1832 that in politics as in war, \"to the victor belong the spoils of the enemy.\" Jackson was never so candid—or so cynical. Creating the \"spoils system\" of partisan manipulation of the patronage was not his conscious intention. Still, it was his doing.\n\nIndian Removal\n\nIndian nations had been largely erased or removed from the northeastern United States by the time Jackson became President. But in the southwest, the Cherokees, Chickasaws, Choctaws, and Creeks still occupied large portions of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee. For many years, Jackson had protested the practice of treating with Indian tribes as if they were foreign nations. Jackson did not hate Indians as a race. He was friendly with many individual Indians and had taken home an Indian orphan from the Creek campaign to raise in his household as a companion to his adopted son. But Jackson did believe that Indian civilization was lower than that of whites, and that for their own survival, tribes who were pressed by white settlement must assimilate as individuals or remove to the west out of harm's way. Confident that he could judge the Indians' true welfare better than they, Jackson, when employed as an Indian negotiator in his army years, had often used threats and bribery to procure cessions of land. Formalities notwithstanding, he regarded tribes resident within the states not as independent sovereign entities but as wards of the government and tenants-at-will.\n\nThe inherent conflict between tribal and state authority came to a head just as Jackson assumed office. The Cherokee nation had acquired many of the attributes of white civilization, including a written language, a newspaper, and a constitution of government. Under its treaties with the federal government, the tribe claimed sovereign authority over its territory in Georgia and adjoining states. Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi countered by asserting state jurisdiction over their Indian domains.\n\nJackson backed the states. He maintained that the federal government had no right to defend the Cherokees against Georgia's encroachments. If the Indians wished to maintain their tribal government and landownership, they must remove beyond the existing states. To facilitate the removal, Jackson induced Congress in 1830 to pass a bill empowering him to lay off new Indian homelands west of the Mississippi, exchange them for current tribal holdings, purchase the Indians' capital improvements, and pay the costs of their westward transportation. This Indian Removal Act was the only major piece of legislation passed at Jackson's behest in his eight years as President.\n\nIndian removal was so important to Jackson that he returned to Tennessee to conduct the first negotiations in person. He gave the Indians a simple alternative: submit to state authority or emigrate beyond the Mississippi. Offered generous aid on one hand and the threat of subjugation on the other, the Chickasaws and Choctaws submitted readily, the Creeks under duress. Only the Cherokees resisted to the bitter end. Tentatively in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia in 1831 and more forcefully in Worcester v. Georgia the next year, the Supreme Court upheld the tribes' independence from state authority. But these legal victories pointed out no practical course of resistance for the tribe to take. Tacitly encouraged by Jackson, Georgia ignored the rulings. Jackson cultivated a minority faction within the tribe, and signed a removal treaty with them in 1835. Though the vast majority of Cherokees rejected the treaty, those who refused to remove under its terms were finally rounded up and transplanted westward by military force in 1838, under Jackson's successor Martin Van Buren. The Cherokees' sufferings in this forced exodus became notorious as the \"Trail of Tears.\"\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of removal treaties closed out pockets of Indian settlement in other states and territories east of the Mississippi. A short military campaign on the upper Mississippi quelled resistance by Black Hawk's band of Sacs and Foxes in 1832, and in 1835 a long and bloody war to subdue the Seminoles in Florida began. Most of the tribes went without force.\n\nGiven the coercion that produced them, most of the removal treaties were fair and even generous. Their execution was miserable. Generally the treaties promised fair payment for the Indians' land and goods, safe transportation to the West and sustenance upon arrival, and protection for the property of those who chose to remain behind under state jurisdiction. These safeguards collapsed under pressure from corrupt contractors, unscrupulous traders, and white trespassers backed by state authority. Jackson's desire to economize and avoid trouble with the state governments further undercut federal efforts to protect the tribes. For this record he bore ultimate responsibility. Jackson did not countenance the abuses, but he did ignore them. Though usually a stickler for the precise letter of formal obligations, he made promises to the Indians that the government did not and perhaps could not fulfill.\n\nThe American System and the Maysville Road Veto\n\nWhen Jackson took office, the leading controversies in Congress concerned the \"American System\" of economic development policies propounded by Henry Clay and furthered by the previous Adams administration. As a senator in 1824, Jackson had backed the System's twin pillars of a protective tariff to foster domestic industry and federal subsidies for transportation projects (known as \"internal improvements\"). These policies were especially popular in the country's mid-section, from Pennsylvania west through Ohio to Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. They were widely hated in much of the South, where they were regarded as devices to siphon wealth from cotton planters to northern manufacturers.\n\nMany Americans judged the American System by its impact on their local interests. Jackson had supported it on national grounds, as a means to build the country's strength and secure its economic independence. Poor transportation in particular had hamstrung the American military effort in the War of 1812. But the unseemly scramble in Congress for favors and subsidies and the rising sectional acrimony over the tariff during the Adams presidency turned Jackson against the System. As a nationalist, he deplored sectional wrangling that threatened disunion, and he came to see protective tariffs and transportation subsidies as vehicles for corruption and for the advancement of special privilege.\n\nJackson announced his new policy by vetoing a bill to aid the Maysville Road in Kentucky in 1830. A string of similar vetoes followed, essentially halting federal internal improvement spending. Reversing himself on the tariff, Jackson renounced protection in 1831 and endorsed a reduction in rates. Invoking Jeffersonian precedent, he urged a return to simple, frugal, minimal government.\n\nAt the same time, Jackson reproved the increasingly strident Southern sectional opposition to the tariff headed by his own vice president, John C. Calhoun of South Carolina. Radical South Carolinians blamed the tariff for all their economic woes and misfortunes. They denounced it as an unconstitutional exercise of congressional power, a measure to illegitimately channel wealth from South to North under the guise of an import tax. Drawing on the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions against the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798, Calhoun fashioned an argument that an individual state, acting through a formal convention, could interpose its authority to declare null and void any federal law that it deemed to violate the Constitution. Jackson thought this nullification doctrine treasonous and absurd. At a political dinner in 1830 he stamped his disapproval on it by staring at Calhoun and toasting, \"Our federal Union: It must be preserved.\"\n\nThe Eaton Affair\n\nJackson was already becoming estranged from Calhoun over a simmering Washington scandal. Jackson's secretary of war, John Henry Eaton, was an old army comrade, Jackson's his campaign biographer, and a Tennessee neighbor. He was the President's one personal confidante in a cabinet made up of near-strangers. Just before the inauguration, Eaton had married Margaret O'Neale Timberlake, the vivacious daughter of a Washington hotelier. Scandalous stories circulated about \"Peggy\" O'Neale, whose first husband, a purser in the Navy, had died abroad under mysterious circumstances not long before her marriage to Eaton. Rumor said that he committed suicide over her dalliance with Eaton. Cabinet wives, including Calhoun's wife Floride, regarded Peggy with abhorrence and conspicuously shunned her.\n\nIn the snubbing of Mrs. Eaton, Jackson saw the kind of vicious persecution that he believed had hounded his own Rachel to her death. He also believed he spied a plot to drive out Eaton from his cabinet, isolate him among strangers, and control his administration. The master of the plot, Jackson came to decide, was Calhoun. He was also shown evidence that during the controversy over his Florida incursion back in 1818, Calhoun had criticized him in Monroe's cabinet while publicly posturing as his defender. Jackson now accused Calhoun of treachery, initiating an angry correspondence that ended with the severing of social relations between the two.\n\nThe Eaton scandal cleaved Jackson's own household. His niece, White House hostess Emily Tennessee Donelson, refused to associate with Mrs. Eaton, and Emily's husband, Jackson's nephew and private secretary Andrew Jackson Donelson, backed her up. The one cabinet officer who stood apart from the snubbing was a man with no wife to contend with—Secretary of State Martin Van Buren of New York, a widower. Jackson was drawn to Van Buren both by his courtliness to Peggy Eaton and his policy views. Van Buren wished to return to the minimalist, strict constructionist governing philosophy of the old Jeffersonian party. In practical political terms, he sought to rebuild the coalition of \"planters and plain republicans\"—put concretely, an alliance of the South with New York and Pennsylvania—that had sustained Jefferson. Van Buren opposed the American System, but on broad philosophical rather than narrow sectional grounds.\n\nAs Jackson separated from Calhoun, he became more intimate with Van Buren. By 1831, the Eaton imbroglio threatened to paralyze the administration. Eaton and Van Buren created a way out: they resigned, giving Jackson an occasion to demand the resignations of the other secretaries and appoint a whole new cabinet. To reward Van Buren, Jackson named him as minister to Great Britain, the highest post in the American diplomatic service. The nomination came before the Senate, where Vice-President Calhoun, on an arranged tie vote, cast the deciding vote against it. Van Buren, who had already assumed his station abroad, came home as a political martyr, Jackson's choice for vice-president in 1832, and his heir apparent to the presidency.\n\nThe Nullification Crisis and the Compromise of 1833\n\nAs Van Buren rose and Calhoun fell, the tariff controversy mounted to a crisis. Congress passed a new tariff in 1832 that reduced some rates but continued the protectionist principle. Some Southerners claimed this as a sign of progress, but South Carolinians saw it as reason to abandon hope in Washington. In November, a state convention declared the tariff unconstitutional and hence null and void. South Carolina's legislature followed up with measures to block the collection of federal custom revenues at the state's ports and to defend the state with arms against federal incursion.\n\nJackson responded on two fronts. He urged Congress to reduce the tariff further, but he also asked for strengthened authority to enforce the revenue laws. Privately, and perhaps for calculated political effect, he talked about marching an army into South Carolina and hanging Calhoun. In December, he issued a ringing official proclamation against nullification. Drafted largely by Secretary of State Edward Livingston, the document questioned Carolinians' obsession with the tariff, reminded them of their patriotic heritage, eviscerated the constitutional theory behind nullification, and warned against taking this fatal step: \"Be not deceived by names. Disunion by armed force is treason. Are you really ready to incur its guilt?\"While Jackson thundered, Congress scrambled for a solution that would avoid civil war. Henry Clay, leader of the congressional opposition to Jackson and stalwart of the American System, joined in odd alliance with John C. Calhoun, who had resigned his lame-duck vice-presidency for a seat in the Senate. They fashioned a bill to reduce the tariff in a series of stages over nine years. Early in 1833, Congress passed this Compromise Tariff and also a \"force bill\" to enforce the revenue laws. Though the Clay-Calhoun forces sought to deny Jackson credit for the settlement, he was fully satisfied with the result. South Carolina, claiming victory, rescinded its nullification of the tariff but nullified the force bill in a final gesture of principled defiance. The Compromise of 1833 brought an end to tariff agitation until the 1840s. First with internal improvements, then with the tariff, the American System had been essentially stymied.\n\nThe Bank Veto\n\nThe congressional Clay-Calhoun alliance foreshadowed a convergence of all Jackson's enemies into a new opposition party. The issue that sealed this coalition, solidified Jackson's own following, and dominated his second term as President was the Second Bank of the United States.\n\nThe Bank of the United States was a quasi-public corporation chartered by Congress to manage the federal government's finances and provide a sound national currency. Headquartered in Philadelphia with branches throughout the states, it was the country's only truly national financial institution. The federal government owned one-fifth of the stock and the President of the United States appointed one-fifth of the directors. Like other banks chartered by state legislatures, the Bank lent for profit and issued paper currency backed by specie reserves. Its notes were federal legal tender. By law, it was also the federal government's own banker, arranging its loans and storing, transferring, and disbursing its funds. The Bank's national reach and official status gave it enormous leverage over the state banks and over the country's supply of money and credit.\n\nThe original Bank of the United States was chartered in 1791 at the urging of Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. Opposition to it was one of the founding tenets of the Jeffersonian Democratic-Republican party. That party allowed the Bank to expire when its twenty-year charter ran out in 1811. But the government's financial misadventures in the War of 1812 forced a reconsideration. In 1816, Congress chartered the Second Bank, again for twenty years.\n\nImprudent lending and corrupt management brought the Second Bank into deep disrepute during the speculative boom-and-bust cycle that culminated in the Panic of 1819. Calls arose for revocation of the charter. But the astute stewardship of new Bank president Nicholas Biddle did much to repair its reputation in the 1820s. By 1828, when Jackson was first elected, the Bank had ceased to be controversial. Indeed, most informed observers deemed it indispensable.\n\nStartling his own supporters, Jackson attacked the Bank in his very first message to Congress in 1829. Biddle attempted to conciliate him, but Jackson's opposition to renewing the charter seemed immovable. He was convinced that the Bank was not only unconstitutional—as Jefferson and his followers had long maintained—but that its concentrated financial power represented a dire threat to popular liberty.\n\nUnder the advice of Senators Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, Biddle sought a congressional recharter in 1832. They calculated that Jackson would not dare issue a veto on the eve of the election; if he did, they would make an issue of it in the campaign. The recharter bill duly passed Congress and on July 10, Jackson vetoed it.\n\nThe veto message was one of the defining documents of Jackson's presidency. Clearly intended for the public eye, parts of it read more like a political manifesto than a communication to Congress. Jackson recited his constitutional objections and introduced some dubious economic arguments, chiefly aimed at foreign ownership of Bank stock. But the crux of the message was its attack on the special privilege enjoyed by private stockholders in a government-chartered corporation. Jackson laid out an essentially laissez-faire vision of government as a neutral arbiter, phrased in a resonant populism:\"It is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes. Distinctions in society will always exist under every just government. Equality of talents, of education, or of wealth can not be produced by human institutions. In the full enjoyment of the gifts of Heaven and the fruits of superior industry, economy, and virtue, every man is equally entitled to protection by law; but when the laws undertake to add to these natural and just advantages artificial distinctions, to grant titles, gratuities, and exclusive privileges, to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful, the humble members of society—the farmers, mechanics, and laborers--who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves, have a right to complain of the injustice of their Government. There are no necessary evils in government. Its evils exist only in its abuses. If it would confine itself to equal protection, and, as Heaven does its rains, shower its favors alike on the high and the low, the rich and the poor, it would be an unqualified blessing.\"\n\nThough some original Jackson men were flabbergasted and outraged at his turn against the Bank, the veto held up in Congress. It became the prime issue in the ensuing presidential campaign, with both sides distributing copies of Jackson's message. Jackson read his re-election as a mandate to pursue his attack on the Bank further.\n\nRemoval of the Deposits\n\nAs soon as the nullification crisis was resolved, Jackson took his next step. The Bank's open involvement in the presidential campaign convinced him more than ever of its inherent corruption. To draw its fangs until its charter ran out in 1836, he determined to withdraw the federal government's own deposits from the Bank and place them in selected state-chartered banks.\n\nThis was a maneuver requiring some delicacy. Under the charter, the secretary of the treasury, not the President, had authority to remove the deposits. He had also to explain his reasons to Congress, where the House of Representatives had just voted by a two-to-one margin that the deposits should stay where they were. Jackson canvassed his cabinet on removal. Most of them opposed it, but he got the support and arguments he needed from Attorney General Roger Taney. Jackson drew up a paper explaining his decision, read it to the cabinet, and ordered Treasury Secretary William John Duane to execute the removal. To Jackson's astonishment, Duane refused. He also refused to resign, so Jackson fired him and put Taney in his place. Taney ordered the removal, which was largely complete by the time Congress convened in December 1833.\n\nEven many congressional foes of the Bank could not countenance Jackson's proceedings against it. He had defied Congress's intent, rode roughshod over the treasury secretary's statutory control over the public purse, and removed the public funds from the lawfully authorized, responsible hands of the Bank of the United States to an untried, unregulated, and perhaps wholly irresponsible collection of state banks. To many, Jackson seemed to regard himself as above the law.\n\nFortunately for Jackson, Bank president Nicholas Biddle over-reacted and played into his hands. Regarding the removal of deposits as a declaration of open war, Biddle determined to force a recharter by creating a financial panic. Loss of the deposits required some curtailment of the Bank's loans, but Biddle carried the contraction further than was necessary in a deliberate effort to squeeze businessmen into demanding a recharter. This manipulation of credit for political ends served only to discredit the Bank and to vindicate Jackson's strictures against it.\n\nCongress did not even consider recharter, but it did lash out at Jackson. Clay men and Southern anti-tariffites could not agree on the American System; they could not all agree on rechartering the Bank; but they could unite in their outrage at Jackson's high-handed proceedings against it. In the 1833-1834 session, Jackson's congressional foes converged to form a new party. They took the name of Whigs, borrowed from Revolutionary-era American and British opponents of royal prerogative.\n\nWhigs held a majority in the Senate. They rejected Jackson's nominees for government directors of the Bank of the United States, rejected Taney as secretary of the treasury, and in March 1834, adopted a resolution of censure against Jackson himself for assuming \"authority and power not conferred by the Constitution and laws, but in derogation of both.\" Jackson protested the censure, arguing that the Senate had adopted the moral equivalent of an impeachment conviction without formal charges, without a trial, and without the necessary two-thirds vote. Led by Thomas Hart Benton, Jackson's defenders mounted a crusade to expunge the censure from the Senate journal. They succeeded in 1837, at the end of Jackson's presidency, after Democrats finally won majority control of the Senate.\n\nHard Money\n\nThe Bank, defeated, retired from the fray after the 1834 session. When its charter expired it accepted a new one from Pennsylvania and continued to operate as a state institution. Meanwhile, the state banks, cut loose from central restraint and gorged with federal funds, went on a lending spree that helped fuel a speculative boom in western lands. Everything came crashing down in the Panic of 1837, which broke just as Jackson retired from office. The ensuing depression plagued Martin Van Buren's presidency and lingered on into the 1840s.\n\nJackson's unsatisfactory experiment with the state banks helped drive his economic thinking toward more radical extremes. He renounced all banknote currency and demanded a return to the \"hard money\" of gold and silver. To that end, and to curb rampant speculation, he ordered the issuance of a \"Specie Circular\" in 1836 requiring payment in coin for western public lands. By the end of his presidency he was attacking all chartered corporations, including manufacturing concerns, turnpike and canal companies, and especially banks, as instruments of aristocratic privilege and engines of oppression. His Farewell Address in 1837, drafted largely by Taney, warned of an insidious \"money power\" that threatened to subvert American liberty.\n\nSlavery and Abolition\n\nDuring Jackson's presidency, the momentous question of slavery intruded forcefully into politics. Northern evangelical opponents of slavery known as abolitionists organized and began to bombard the nation and Congress with pleas and petitions to rid the republic of this great wrong. Defenders of slavery responded with denunciations and with violence. They demanded in the interest of public safety that criticism of slavery be not only answered, but silenced. Some, especially the South Carolina nullifiers, linked abolitionism to the tariff as part of a systematic campaign of Northern sectional oppression against the South.\n\nThere is nothing to show that Jackson ever pondered slavery as a fundamental moral question. Such thinking was not in his character: he was a man of action, not of philosophy. He grew up with the institution of slavery and accepted it uncritically. Like his neighbors, he bought and sold slaves and used them to work his plantation and wait on his needs. Jackson reacted to the abolitionist controversy in purely political terms. He perceived it as a threat to sectional harmony and to his own national Democratic party, and on that ground he condemned the agitation of both sides.\n\nDuring Jackson's administration, Congress began adopting annual \"gag rules\" to keep discussion of abolition petitions off the House and Senate floor. In 1835, abolitionists sent thousands of antislavery tracts through the mails directly to southern clergy, officials, and prominent citizens. Many of these were never delivered, intercepted by southern postmasters or by angry mobs. Jackson and Postmaster General Amos Kendall approved their action. Jackson recommended federal suppression of \"incendiary publications\" and damned the abolitionists' \"wicked attempts\" to incite a slave rebellion. His Farewell Address in 1837 warned of the dangers of sectional fanaticism, both northern and southern.", "authors": ["Daniel Feller"], "publish_date": "2016/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/9/analysis-end-of-imran-khans-term", "title": "What led to leader Imran Khan's downfall in Pakistan? | Imran Khan ...", "text": "Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party lost the support of coalition allies, denying a majority he needed to defeat a no-confidence vote.\n\nImran Khan’s tumultuous term as prime minister of Pakistan has ended, following weeks of high political drama and days of constitutional chaos.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s landmark verdict late on Thursday restored a parliament that Khan had sought to disband and mandated a vote of no confidence that he sought to avoid.\n\nKhan was effectively left with a choice: resign or be voted out of office.\n\nThe former prime minister’s political demise was rooted in twin new realities. Inside parliament, Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had lost the support of coalition allies, denying him the majority he needed to defeat the vote of no confidence.\n\nOutside parliament, Khan appeared to lose the support of Pakistan’s powerful military, which the opposition alleged helped him win the 2018 general election, and had recently publicly fallen out with the prime minister over senior military appointments and policy decisions.\n\nThe PTI and the military have denied the allegations.\n\nIn recent weeks, as the principal opposition parties, the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N), ramped up their efforts to dislodge Khan, coalition allies became vocal in their dissatisfaction with him.\n\n“As far as governance was concerned, the government had totally failed,” said Senator Anwaar ul Haq Kakar of the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP), a coalition ally that withdrew support for Khan in late March.\n\n“There was disgruntlement for the past two years,” Kakar added. “The party [BAP] was not happy about its share in the federal government and the ministerial portfolio it has been allocated.”\n\nThe sour mood among Khan’s erstwhile allies was echoed by Nadeem Afzal Chan, a special assistant to the prime minister who resigned his position and rejoined the opposition PPP in early March.\n\n“I was impressed by Khan’s anti-corruption platform and was tired of the status quo,” Chan said. “But then I saw that while Khan publicly talked about the poor, privately he surrounded himself with wealthy investors.”\n\nEconomic distress\n\nA deepening economic crisis contributed to dissatisfaction with Khan with double-digit inflation dogging much of his term.\n\nIn February, as opposition momentum against Khan built, the prime minister announced a cut in domestic fuel and electricity prices despite a global rise, pledging to freeze prices until the end of the fiscal year in June.\n\nThe move piled further pressure on Pakistan’s chronic fiscal deficit and balance-of-payment troubles. This week, the rupee fell to historic lows against the US dollar and the State Bank of Pakistan sharply increased interest rates in an emergency meeting.\n\n“Part of it was the situation they inherited from the previous government and part of it was of course COVID,” said Shahrukh Wani, an economist at the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford.\n\n“But the government fell quickly into firefighting and reforms were never taken up.”\n\nFor former Khan allies such as Chan, discontent among constituency voters had tipped over. “Inflation, fertiliser shortages, local government in Punjab, policing, it had all got too much,” Chan said.\n\nInside parliament, the loss of the allies’ support reversed the numbers for Khan. BAP, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and Pakistan Muslim League – Quaid (PML-Q) account for fewer than five percent of the seats in the 342-member National Assembly.\n\nBut by pledging to support the no-confidence vote against Khan, the coalition allies effectively ended Khan’s three and a half year spell as prime minister. The opposition parties also claimed to have the support of a number of dissident PTI parliamentarians.\n\nMeanwhile, the economy remains in a parlous state. Miftah Ismail, a former PML-N finance minister tipped to resume the post he held in 2018, said: “The two biggest economic challenges facing Pakistan at the moment are high inflation and fast depleting foreign exchange reserves.\n\n“The difficulty is that as the currency has been devaluing due to decreasing reserves, it gives rise to even more inflation.”\n\nMilitary’s role\n\nWith Khan’s exit confirmed, former allies are increasingly candid about the third rail of Pakistani politics: civil-military relations.\n\nThe prime minister’s parliamentary support began to dissolve when the military signalled it would not side with Khan against the opposition, a policy of so-called neutrality.\n\n“When the establishment became neutral, the allies saw that the government wouldn’t survive,” Senator Kakar of BAP said. “Once the view was entrenched that he can’t stay, it was only a matter of time.”\n\nKhan is the latest in a long line of Pakistani prime ministers who have fallen out with the military over key appointments and foreign policy.\n\nIn October, simmering civil-military tensions exploded in public view when Khan tried to retain Lieutenant-General Faiz Hameed as the military spy chief, rejecting the nominee of army chief General Qamar Bajwa.\n\nGeneral Bajwa’s nominee, Lieutenant-General Nadeem Anjum, was eventually appointed as the new director general of Inter-Services Intelligence, but the weeks-long standoff was bruising and ominous.\n\nGeneral Bajwa’s second term as army chief will end in November, with General Hameed one of the senior-most generals eligible to replace him. The Pakistani prime minister appoints the army chief.\n\nExtraordinary, too, was Khan’s attempt to recast ties with the US, Pakistan’s largest trading partner and a fractious ally that the military has sought to maintain as an important partner.\n\nIn February, in pursuit of what Khan described as a neutral foreign policy, Khan travelled to Russia seeking trade deals on the eve of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He left with only a handshake from Russian President Vladimir Putin hours after the attack began on February 24.\n\nWhile the Pakistani military backed Khan’s Moscow trip, differences intensified after Khan made a high-stakes domestic pivot. Faced with defeat in the no-confidence vote in parliament, Khan alleged a US-led plot to remove him as punishment for his Russia trip and neutral foreign policy.\n\nAs evidence of the plot, Khan waved a letter in a public rally in Islamabad on March 27, claiming the US had delivered a diplomatic warning to Pakistan to remove him as prime minister.\n\nThe diplomatic missive, the alleged US threat, and Khan’s claim that the no-confidence was part of a US-led conspiracy roiled Pakistani politics and civil-military relations.\n\nRetired Major-General Athar Abbas, a former military spokesperson and Pakistan’s Ambassador to Ukraine from 2015 to 2018, said: “The letter warranted a strong response and corrective measures. Response [in the military] is mixed on whether it should have been used to meddle with the vote of no confidence.”\n\nGeneral Abbas also described a number of differences between Khan and the military leadership that had accumulated over Khan’s time in office, including poor political and economic management by Khan that was acting as a drag on the military’s public image.\n\nOn Khan’s opposition to military operations inside Pakistan and US-led wars internationally since the September 11 attacks, General Abbas said: “PM’s position on war on terror is that we fought America’s war and suffered loss of men and material. Military’s view was that it was the fallout of the Afghan war and we had no choice.\n\n“Pressure on military leadership is if it was America’s war, then all the sacrifices of young officers and soldiers were a waste,” Abbas said.\n\nAnother retired military official, Air Vice-Marshal Shahzad Chaudhry, suggested the tensions with the military also concerned Khan’s style of governing.\n\n“On policy matters, Khan could be mercurial. There was no predictability or stability. Imran Khan is a populist, that’s his vulnerability too.”\n\nDefeated inside parliament and undone outside, Khan though is unlikely to be a spent force politically. The cyclical nature of Pakistani politics has seen former prime ministers rebound before.\n\nKhan also has the advantage of clawing his way back to power from a fertile political base.\n\nChan, the former special assistant to the prime minister, said, “A month ago, people were abusing [Khan and the PTI government] for inflation.\n\n“Now, they say he’s stood up for a proud and independent Pakistan.”", "authors": ["Cyril Almeida"], "publish_date": "2022/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-nation-the-war-vietnam", "title": "Address to the Nation on the War in Vietnam | The American ..."}, {"url": "https://www.brookings.edu/articles/misinformation-is-eroding-the-publics-confidence-in-democracy/", "title": "Misinformation is eroding the public's confidence in democracy"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65014336", "title": "France pension reform: Macron's government survives no ..."}, {"url": "https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/09/05/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-united-states-what-research-says-pub-90457", "title": "Polarization, Democracy, and Political Violence in the United States ...", "text": "Summary\n\nThe United States feels roiled by polarization, and the philanthropic world is seized with debates about what to do. Some scholars claim that Americans are so polarized they are on the brink of civil war. Other polls suggest that voters agree on plenty of policies and that polarization is an illusion. Some philanthropists call for pluralism and civility, while others lean into activism, believing polarization is a byproduct of change toward a more just world.

Americans across parties share many policy preferences. There is some overlap even on hot-button issues, such as abortion and guns, and more overlap on how to teach American history.1 It is important not to make too much of this overlap, however. For instance, a majority of Democrats as well as four in ten Republicans support banning high-capacity ammunition magazines and creating a federal database to track gun sales; nearly as many Republicans support banning assault-style weapons. But only 18 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaners feel gun violence is a major problem (versus 73 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaners). So despite the significant policy overlap, only one side is motivated to put the issue on the agenda.2 Democrats have moved to the left on racial issues and some social issues over the last decade, and Republicans have moved to the right on immigration under Joe Biden’s administration, though there remains overlap on these issues as well.3 In some cases, Republicans appear to be slowly adopting more progressive views on some social issues, resulting in what looks like polarization but is perhaps better characterized as faster moves by the left.4 However, most partisans hold major misbeliefs about the other party’s preferences that lead them to think there is far less shared policy belief. This perception gap is highest among progressive activists, followed closely by extreme conservatives: in other words, the people who are most involved in civic and political life hold the least accurate views of the other side’s beliefs. Figure 1 shows the gap between what groups of Americans think the other side believes and what they self-report believing, as of 2019. American politicians are highly ideologically polarized. In other words, they believe in and vote for different sets of policies, with little overlap. This trend has grown in a steady, unpunctuated manner for decades.5 One reason that the most highly politically engaged Americans may misunderstand the other side is that they correctly estimate the extreme ideological polarization among politicians. It is easy to assume that polarized voters are selecting more polarized leaders—and that theory may hold true for recent primary elections. However, that is not the main story. The process begins long before voters get a choice: more ideologically extreme politicians have been running for office since the 1980s.6 Among the pool of people wishing to run, party chairs more often select and support extreme candidates, especially on the right. (In 2013, Republican party chairs at the county level selected ten extreme candidates for every one moderate; the ratio was two to one for Democrats.) The increase in “safe” seats, in which one party is overwhelmingly likely to win, explains candidate and party preferences for more polarizing platforms, but it does not explain the depth of the Republican preference.7 Parties and candidates clearly believe that more polarizing candidates are more likely to win elections. This may be a self-fulfilling prophecy: voters exposed to more polarizing rhetoric from leaders who share their partisan identity are likely to alter their preferences based on their understanding of what their group believes and has normalized—particularly among primary voters whose identity is more tied to their party. 8 However, only about 20 percent of each party votes in primaries, and 41 percent of Americans are independents who may not have strong party identity and are barred from voting in some states’ primaries.9 That leaves the majority of voters with a relatively low ability to pick a less polarizing candidate of their party. Philanthropists and prodemocracy organizations attempting to reduce polarization often assume that the problem they must grapple with is polarized voters, but their interventions should also take into account the fact that that some of the ideological extremism and polarization since the 1980s is candidate- and party-driven. While at this point, candidates and parties may be responding to polarized primary voters, candidates and parties have been driving the polarization, and not all voters are ideologically polarized. The disparity between where leaders are ideologically and where their voters are precludes legislative policy agreement on many issues. Average voters are not able to assert their (often weak) policy preferences because they do not have an effective way to vote out representatives who do not accurately represent their constituents’ views, particularly on the right where party chairs are likely to substitute one extreme candidate for another. Even though Americans are not as ideologically polarized as they believe themselves to be, they are emotionally polarized (known as “affective polarization”). In other words, they do not like members of the other party. Americans harbor strong dislike for members of the other party (though they also dislike their own parties, as well).10 While social media is often blamed for this phenomenon, affective polarization started growing before the internet: its onset more closely correlates with the rise of cable news and radio talk shows.11 It is also growing most swiftly among Americans over sixty-five years old, a demographic that uses the internet less, but watches television and listens to talk radio far more, than younger age groups who are less polarized.12 These findings and other studies about the effects of social media suggest that all media, not just social media, may be playing a role. Many studies have considered what could reduce these feelings of dislike for the other party. They have found that affective polarization appears to be driven largely by an individual’s misbeliefs about the policy beliefs of the other party, a sense that members of the other party dislike members of their party, a fear that the other party supports breaking democratic norms, and misunderstandings about the demographic composition of the other party (for example, believing that Republicans are old, wealthy, evangelical Christians, while Democrats are young, unionized minorities, when the median demographic characteristics of both parties are actually quite similar).13 Correcting these misperceptions can help reduce affective polarization. Studies have found that telling people in a believable way that they share policy beliefs and similar demographics and creating a sense that there is a shared identity (though the latter is complicated for minorities who prefer dual identities) are interventions that can reduce affective polarization.14 Often, bringing people together across difference is used to accomplish these ends, and this contact between groups may reduce affective polarization.15 There is a problem with engaging in such interventions to improve U.S. democracy, however. While affective polarization is growing quickly in the United States, it is actually not much higher there than in many European countries. In other words, many European countries show affective polarization at about the same level as that of the United States, but their democracies are not suffering as much, suggesting that something about the U.S. political system, media, campaigns, or social fabric is allowing Americans’ level of emotional polarization to be particularly harmful to U.S. democracy.16 Affective polarization is unlikely to be causing democratic backsliding or political violence on its own. The problem is not polarized emotions alone but how those feelings interact with voting systems, candidate incentives, and personal relationships. A series of studies found that it was possible to reduce affective polarization in lab tests, though these effects were only tested after short periods. (The most successful intervention managed to reduce animosity to its 1980s level, but the effects crumbled after a week.)17 But even successful lab interventions had no effect on attitudes toward political violence and other antidemocratic behaviors. For example, experiments that reduced affective polarization among participants found no marked changes in respondents’ willingness to support their party if a candidate employed antidemocratic means to suppress the vote, redraw districts “even if it may be technically illegal,” suppress a protest by the other side, or engage in corruption.18 Reducing affective polarization also did not affect survey respondents’ loyalty to their members of Congress (who may have engaged in some of these behaviors) or increase their desire for bipartisanship. In other words, affective polarization levels describe how people feel interpersonally about the other party’s members. But those feelings do not directly influence how they may behave—they may feel more warmly toward another party but are still likely to vote the same way, support the same policy positions, and have the same levels of disrespect for democratic norms, among other behaviors. These studies are confounding: how can emotions change without people altering their attitudes or actions? It is more understandable if one considers a typical effort to reduce affective polarization, such as bringing a group of Democrats together with Republicans over a dinner, or a series of dinners, full of richly moderated discussions and interpersonal insights. That experience may lead the individuals involved to understand each other better and feel more warmly toward the entire groups each side represents. But even if their emotions have shifted by 20 percent—a huge effect—their voting cannot alter by 20 percent because there are only two parties to choose from. So for feelings to affect votes in a two-party system, the dinner guests must engage in a major shift of identity. Alternatively, they may feel more warmly toward the other party but vote as they did before, leaving them with some cognitive dissonance. Most are likely to take the latter path and resolve the dissonance by reducing their warm feelings over time. Similarly, after the dinner has deepened understanding and positive feelings, most people will return to their existing religious congregations, friendships, workplaces, and other institutional affiliations. If they have really had a deep moment of change, they may speak up in these settings for their newfound appreciation. But if they meet resistance after sharing their new emotions, they are likely to retreat back into polarization over time. The lab experiments (and findings from real-world examples such as decades of attempts to improve relationships between Israelis and Palestinians) suggest that short-term work to change individual feelings will decay over time in the face of these broader pressures unless immense care is taken to build deep, long-term friendships or create another set of relationships or institutions for people to spend time in that will allow them to act on their altered feelings.19 In other words, it is not that affective polarization is unimportant: antidemocratic behavior is unlikely to change unless underlying emotions among the voting public change. But it is as if emotions are on a hypothetical dial that can be shifted by degrees, while most behavior is on a dial that has only a few preset settings. For emotional change to yield lasting impacts, people must have more behavioral options—groups of differently minded friends to shift to (which is particularly hard in sparsely populated rural areas), a broader set of political choices, and other options in their social and political spaces. Similarly, affective polarization is not causing political violence directly. It is probably contributing to an environment that allows politicians and opinion leaders to increase violence targeted at politicians, election officials, women, and many types of minorities. Affective polarization in the United States has been rising for decades, while political violence only increased sharply in 2016.20 Affective polarization is also quite symmetrical across parties, while political violence is overwhelmingly from the right.21 This suggests that emotional feelings of hatred toward members of the other party are not a primary cause of political violence. In fact, some scholars have found that affective polarization is not even correlated with political violence or justifications of such violence (though other surveys have found correlation between “strong Republicans” or “Make America Great Again (MAGA) Republicans” and support for violence, while the same does not hold true for “strong Democrats”).22 It certainly feels as if the vitriol and violence-mongering in U.S. politics has something to do with the recent increase in political violence. How can this discrepancy be explained? People who commit political violence have aggressive personalities.23 Many who commit forms of political violence that do not include preplanning—such as most hate crimes, threats, and violence at rallies—also have poor self-control or have lowered their self-control temporarily (by drinking, for instance).24 These traits are shared across individuals who commit all forms of violence. What is unique about political violence is that it does not arise from interpersonal friction. Instead, for people with low self-control (a large pool that includes, for instance, teenage boys and anyone who has drunk in excess) and aggressive personalities (which limits that pool somewhat) to turn to violence, they need to be enraged and have that anger directed at a group of people they don’t know. They also need to believe that they will not face severe consequences or not care about consequences (because they are too impulsive to care or because they think the consequences are worth it). In moments of low political polarization, aggressive people whose impulse control is low are likely to focus most of their rage on personal interactions: domestic violence, road rage, violent crime, or even a school or workplace shooting. Some may commit hate crimes if they are prejudiced and come across a member of a minority group. Those experiencing psychosis or using particular drugs that create illusions of grandeur may direct anger toward political figures, but they are more likely to focus that desire for a sense of importance on a nearer target, such as their school or workplace. Only an insignificant number will act; most pose greater harm to themselves. In other words, in a low-polarization environment, aggressive, impulsive individuals who don’t fear consequences may commit violence, but the targets will largely be apolitical. Meanwhile, violence is likely to be lower because people are facing only self-generated rage, not an additional level of anger and grievance projected toward people outside their personal interactions. However, as partisan leaders and media personalities demonize the other party, they can create feelings of rage among followers who fear the consequences of the other party’s perceived actions. Dehumanizing and denigrating rhetoric that normalizes violence or threats against some groups turns that sense of fear and anger into a target by making certain groups appear to be both threatening and, at the same time, vulnerable.25 Finally, the normalization of violence by political leaders, in particular, may provide a sense that acting violently against those groups will be permitted, may not be punished, or could be lauded and turn one into a hero (such as how Kyle Rittenhouse was supported monetarily and publicly embraced after he traveled to Wisconsin to offer “protection” from a Black Lives Matter protest and shot and killed two people).26 Thus, the individuals committing political violence may not be very polarized themselves; they may even be fairly apolitical. But in seeking to connect to and belong within a political community, they may find leaders who make violence seem normal or even laudable, build followers’ rage, and suggest a target for that anger in a political figure, government official, or minority scapegoat. Affective polarization within society gives them a way to cloak violent impulses in a greater cause that may even allow them to imagine themselves socially embraced or heroized (a potent draw for individuals who may feel ostracized because of their irritable, aggrieved personalities). And hints that political leaders accept such violence reduces concerns about the consequences of their violence, which might otherwise stop them from taking part in a rally or other event where their aggression could manifest. As political leaders gin up anger and reduce the sense of consequences, and as affective polarization creates a sense of community and belonging for aggressive, more authoritarian personalities, all types of targeted violence are increasing. Not only are American politicians (from school board members to representatives in Congress) receiving more threats, but also, threats against judges are up, hate crimes are at the highest recorded point in the twenty-first century, and mass shootings are spiking, with perpetrators adopting some political rhetoric into their manifestos or targeting scapegoated groups.27 Conversely, if Americans had very high levels of affective polarization, but politicians, media leaders, and local leaders maintained a stance of equanimity and civility toward the other party, political violence would probably not increase much outside of particularly virulent subcommunities. This is what occurred in the 1980s when violence rose within the neo-Nazi skinhead movement and in the 1990s when violence grew within the militia movement; both movements were viewed as unacceptable by the vast majority of partisan leaders so violence did not spill into wider society. Affective polarization probably requires alterations to leader rhetoric, norms of violence acceptability within a community, and the perceived likelihood of punishment to increase violence across American society. These other variables may be amenable to faster alteration than levels of affective polarization across a society. Understanding the key role of political and opinion leaders in manipulating affective polarization has led to a newer way of looking at polarization that is just starting to spread to U.S. democracy experts but is more prevalent among scholars who compare different political systems and scholars who study civil wars. They consider the structure of politics, looking at whether a variety of identities have collapsed into just two opposing groups that see each other as threatening and even immoral. And they look at whether such polarization can be instrumentalized by politicians as a winning political strategy. Jennifer McCoy, who has pioneered looking at the ways in which emotions and political strategies intersect, finds that the United States has been more “perniciously polarized” for longer than any consolidated democracy has ever been.28\n\nWhat This Understanding Means for Interventions\n\nThese findings suggest that efforts to tackle polarization must be carefully calibrated to have an effect on what is usually described as their ultimate goal: a resilient democracy with strengthened guardrails and less political violence.\n\nPluralism programs to bridge differences are not enough to improve democracy. Instead, interventions to change individuals’ emotions must be paired with efforts that alter how politicians are incentivized to instrumentalize or amplify affective polarization as a strategy. Programs focused solely on engaging individuals from different groups to talk about their differences are based on intergroup contact theory. That literature suggests that these programs can, if well structured, successfully change the feelings of the people who participate (though they can create backlash and harden prejudice if poorly structured).29 However, just as affective polarization can be reduced in lab settings without impacting views and behaviors regarding democracy and political violence, talking across difference can reduce individual affective polarization—but there is no evidence that it impacts those individuals’ antidemocratic behaviors, preferences for antidemocratic candidates, or support for political violence. Nor is there any evidence that changing feelings on an individual level will aggregate into democratic improvements. A literature review of peacebuilding programs in other countries concluded that “programming that focuses on change at the Individual/Personal level, but that never links or translates into action at the Socio-Political level has no discernible effect on peace.”30 Lab research suggests that similar results will hold in the United States. As Mina Cikara, a psychology professor at Harvard University, has explained, “we frequently see equivalent degrees of out-party dislike on both sides, but there’s only one party seeking to curb voting access and throw out election results.”31 Efforts to talk across divides and reduce emotional dislike can improve understanding and reduce prejudice, but these interventions will not result in social or political improvements unless the trusting relationships that are created eventually lead to collaboration that alters broader social norms or political incentives.32 Interventions should aim to reduce feelings of threat, not just feelings of dislike. The most effective interventions for reducing both affective polarization and antidemocratic attitudes involve reducing fears that the other side is intent on breaking democratic norms. A number of studies have found that partisans overestimate the willingness of the other side to break democratic norms and that overestimation makes them more likely to support or even take antidemocratic practices for their side.33 The same holds for political violence.34 The only interventions that currently appear to have a valuable effect on antidemocratic attitudes as well as affective polarization focus on correcting the particular misbeliefs about the other side’s willingness to break democratic norms.35 For instance, lab experiments in which participants watched a video of Utah’s gubernatorial candidates discussing how each would honor the results of the 2020 election reduced participants’ support for their own side taking antidemocratic action. Correcting misperceptions by simply presenting the data reduces support for antidemocratic action, but only marginally because people may find the data unbelievable. When best practices are used to increase believability—such as showing people talking—they can significantly reduce support for antidemocratic action, but the effects do not seem to last for long, given the onslaught of contrary news in real-life contexts.36 Nevertheless, it is worth focusing less on the emotions of dislike that Americans may have for one another and focusing more on perceptions of threat—particularly specific fears that the other party will undermine democracy to gain power. Quelling these fears could reduce the arms race. Unfortunately, much prodemocracy programming enhances fear that the other side poses an existential threat to democracy. The attempt to use fear to get voters to pay attention to serious threats to democracy is understandable, particularly raising alarms in certain states or about certain politicians given the degree to which the Republican Party is being taken over by an antidemocratic faction. However, the broad sweep of fear may encourage people to vote while also building support for antidemocratic behavior. This is a real problem the prodemocracy community must consider seriously, possibly by experimenting with more positive, aspirational mobilizing strategies rather than relying on threats. The effects on younger voters, who are already less attached to the democratic system than other demographics, may be particularly harmful over time.37 At the same time, misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation regarding Democratic election malfeasance are creating the same real sense of threat and desire for undemocratic action to save democracy on the Republican side. This arms race is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is the core issue of the affective polarization problem. But as the most recent understanding of polarization suggests, changing feelings alone is not enough. Altering the sense of threat also requires changing political incentives that allow politicians to use hatred, othering, and claims that the other side is immoral as a winning political strategy. Win-lose-style, adversarial advocacy on the right-left dimension might be dangerous. Based on the finding above, advocacy that amplifies the belief that members of the other party are bent on destroying democracy itself is likely to deepen polarization and support for antidemocratic action on one’s own side. (So might a similar style of advocacy on issues adjacent to democracy, such as reproductive rights on the left or gun rights on the right, that campaigns by hardening beliefs that the other side is going to do away with democracy to solidify their control over the policy). The more each side fears the other is going to subvert the rules of the game, the more willing voters seem to be to do it first to lock in their party’s advantage. Meanwhile, highly partisan ideological advocacy may be subverting democracy indirectly. Highly adversarial advocacy in which partisans on one side of an issue are amassed, angered, and organized to change a policy along strict partisan lines is very likely to fail, given the intense ideological polarization of U.S. leaders and the overuse of the filibuster such that supermajorities are required for legislation to pass. Frequent failure to achieve reforms may be hardening misperceptions among voters about the average voter in the other party. Advocacy efforts that organize people toward such failed efforts can leave people more cynical. Meanwhile, levels of affective polarization are such that highly publicized, adversarial advocacy attempts are likely to generate backlash. Thus, this form of adversarial advocacy is likely to achieve few victories at the national level (though it may be able to achieve state-level change in reliably red or blue states). In either case, such success will generate backlash in other states or at the national level, creating Pyrrhic victories that are quickly overturned at the national level or are met with opposing legislation in other states. The United States may reach a point where the best it can hope for is to shore up democracy and inclusion in some states while abandoning others to a less democratic and inclusive future. This is, after all, what occurred under Jim Crow for eight decades. But America is not at this point yet, and an advocacy style that pushes the country closer to such a dystopic fate is in no way helpful to the goals of social justice. Instead, intense mobilization efforts built around a positive future vision are needed to galvanize voters without exacerbating antidemocratic attitudes. A different form of pluralistic work that coordinates groups to act on shared goals, despite other differences of opinion, may work to bridge partisanship, build trust, and advance a more just democracy. Even in today’s ideologically polarized Congress, progress has been made toward a more inclusive and stronger democracy using a strategy of coordinated action across difference. In 2022, with current levels of affective polarization, this type of programming led to success in reforming the Electoral Count Act, a crucial node for shoring up the U.S. democracy’s guardrails. It achieved the country’s only lasting, national modern criminal justice reform in 2018 and enshrined a national legal right to gay marriage in 2022. Advocacy framed to welcome Republicans as well as Democrats has allowed reproductive rights to gain ground in multiple states since the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade. Such programming has also been the bedrock of effective peacebuilding efforts in countries such as Colombia and Sierra Leone. Programming to bridge differences, not simply to talk but to find common ground among unlikely allies in order to act on shared problems, has another benefit: it may build trust and a sense of agency. A majority of the voting public are disgusted by politics in general, which they feel is corrupt and rigged against people like themselves.38 While they report feelings of affective polarization against the other party, 40 percent of Republicans also did not like their own political side until the MAGA movement.39 The affective polarization conversation misses the reality that a portion of angry, low-trust Americans do not simply dislike the other party but distrust nearly every institution in American life: big business, schools, newspapers, television news, Congress, the criminal justice system, and organized religion, among others.40 In reality, they are polarized from a political and economic system that feels separate (hence “elite”) and insensitive to their needs. While polling geared toward affective polarization has found them disgusted with the other party, they in fact feel frustrated and hopeless about the entire U.S. political and economic system in general. Instead of focusing on polarization, the alienation they feel needs to be addressed by enabling agency around problems they—and the people they are often pitted against in more simplistic media accounts—both want solved. These issues may be highly local, for instance, building a community’s resilience against more frequent extreme weather. Or they may entail major national mobilization, such as bringing together conservative religious groups and gay activists to pass the Respect for Marriage Act, which enshrined gay marriage as a national law just as it was under threat from Supreme Court rulings. Understanding which problems are shared and solvable cannot be guessed beforehand: it requires discussion and trust-building. Empirical evidence from overseas and from the United States has found that assembling groups across difference to talk can make a significant difference in a highly polarized atmosphere, if the goal is to uncover shared elements of a common agenda on which groups can act.41 In these cases, talking is not an end in itself but is used to build trust so that groups can work on concrete advocacy that moves countries toward less-polarized politics. Such advocacy can be highly adversarial, but against new lines of polarization rather than the right-left dimension (for example, uniting minority and White working-class Americans for better working conditions or bringing together rural White and minority Americans for recognition of rural needs as opposed to urban assumptions). Ironically, since misbeliefs about the other side’s policy preferences are strongest among highly educated, partisan political activists (and highest on the left), programs that attempt to solve problems by gaining understanding and working with unlikely allies on shared issues of concern may face the greatest pushback by those who claim to be most politically knowledgeable. This may obstruct the ability to build trust and agency among less politically engaged minority and White Americans whose preferences are quite different from those of engaged political elites. Polarization is a highly nuanced field, and small assumptions can lead to big mistakes. Practitioners and philanthropists should be particularly careful about assumptions regarding moderation. People who poll as moderates may also be antidemocratic or supportive of political violence, especially on the right. On the left, support for democracy may coincide with support for violence. Many people think of Americans as arrayed along a straight line, with the far left on one side and the far right on the other. They assume that the people at the edges are the most polarized, the most partisan, hold the most extreme ideological views, and are the most supportive of antidemocratic actions and violence. This is not the case. Consistent conservatives and liberals who are more politically engaged are both more affectively and ideologically polarized and more prodemocracy than those in the middle.42 A frequent misunderstanding is that people who hold ideological views that contain elements from both sides of the aisle are moderates because they fall in the middle of the left-right spectrum. In fact, a Democracy Fund survey in 2018 found that Americans who held the least polarized ideological beliefs were actually the voting cohort least in favor of democracy and most supportive of a “strong leader” who does not need to bother with Congress or elections.43 It is a common assumption that people who hold views from both sides of the aisle are economically conservative and socially liberal—the profile of many in the upper-middle-class political elite trying to reduce polarization. In fact, a 2016 study showed that this type of moderate ideology was held by only 3.8 percent of the electorate. Instead, the preponderance of Americans who respond to ideological survey questions with answers on both sides of the aisle (28.9 percent of the electorate) tend to be pro–economic redistribution while also upholding the belief that American citizens should be White, Christian, and born in the United States.44 That mix of views led this group to be swing voters for many years, although since 2016 many have moved more decisively into the Republican Party. This group, many of whom support an authoritarian leader and some of whom justify political violence when necessary to maintain traditional gender roles and a White-dominated racial hierarchy, may be highly affectively polarized—but they also may not be, since they tend to distrust all American institutions and elites.45 Some view themselves as strong partisan Republicans, so surveys such as Bright Line Watch found that people who strongly identified as Republican a year after the contested 2020 election were the most supportive of political violence.46 But others feel little partisan affiliation. They have voted for both parties in the past and seek someone to represent their views; if a third party of a Trumpian orientation emerged, they might switch to it. While they were united by their votes for Donald Trump in 2020 and their belief that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, they may be willing to mobilize in the future behind another strong, extreme leader: many of the most radical are no longer willing to turn out violently for Trump rallies because they feel let down by his failure to provide monetary support for those arrested on January 6.47 They are probably best characterized simply as the antidemocratic right, a growing counterculture with high distrust, a low sense of agency, and strong feelings of grievance and victimhood. On the left, the most partisan Democrats are actually far more moderate ideologically than progressives. In other words, on the left, extreme partisanship coincides with moderate ideology. The problem for democracy on the left is not those who report high polarization (those individuals tend to be active and politically engaged in a positive way for democracy), but a very small but vocal group that the international anti-polarization organization More in Common terms “activist mavericks.”48 These individuals are younger and wealthier than average Americans and more often male. They are far-left in their ideology, but they dislike the Democratic Party and so are not partisan (though they may be affectively polarized and hate Republicans). They claim to be very strongly prodemocratic. But they do not believe America has achieved democracy, and so they are willing to support political violence to achieve greater racial and democratic representation. Six in ten support property crime (versus 6 percent of Americans overall), and 28 percent support violence against people (versus 4 percent of the population overall). These two groups are asymmetric: the antidemocratic right is a plurality of somewhere between a quarter and a third of the Republican Party.49 The proviolence left is tiny and composes an insignificant part of the vote share of Democrats, especially since many may vote for third parties. Both are surrounded, however, by a penumbra of apologists and soft supporters who normalize their behavior. This has allowed the antidemocratic faction of the right to achieve a nearly complete takeover of the Republican Party that is giving it significant political power. Maverick activists on the left hold virtually no political power at any level of government, but their views have achieved outsized cultural sway. Despite their asymmetry, the bogeyman of these two groups is fueling the other and is the main force tearing the country apart—not a more generic or symmetrical polarization. Thus, it may be worth testing interventions focused precisely on these groups, as well as supporting independent, high-quality research alongside these programs to track behavioral outcomes over the short, medium, and long term. Or it might be worth testing interventions to build the prodemocracy habits and norms of Americans who are supportive of but not quite within these more virulent subcultures. To be of any use, these interventions and research must be done in real-world conditions, not just quick lab experiments, and studied over time.\n\nThe Literature on Polarization\n\nIn the 1950s, some influential U.S. scholars argued that America needed more polarization, which they defined as members of different parties holding differing policy beliefs. At the time, each of the two dominant parties encompassed a breadth of often overlapping political views thanks to conservative Southern Democrats and liberal Rockefeller Republicans. A famous American Political Science Review study from 1950 concluded that more polarization would help voters differentiate between the parties.50 These beliefs persisted among some of the most highly regarded scholars in the polarization field, such as the University of Pennsylvania’s Matthew Levendusky, well into the 2000s.51\n\nYet other experts took into account massive sociopolitical changes that affected how they viewed polarization. First came the Civil Rights Movement. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 sent former Southern Democrats into the Republican Party, accelerating a process of party sorting by ideology that was largely influenced by racial prejudice.52 Subsequent cultural cleavages over women’s rights, gay rights, and the environment, combined with polarization over the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal, continued the process of deepening ideological differences, while demographic sorting among the electorate put more liberals on the Democratic side and more conservatives on the Republican side of the aisle.53 A few crucial politicians, notably speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich, amplified these cleavages during the 1990s through a style of intensely partisan leadership that deepened the effects of these cultural and ideological differences on key institutions—in particular, Congress.54\n\nFirst Generation Understanding: Elite Ideological Polarization\n\nPolarization Is Policy Difference, Congress Is the Problem\n\nBy the early 2000s, members of Congress and people working on what was then called “good government” began to feel that polarization was a problem. They bemoaned a lack of compromise in Congress and a more poisonous atmosphere that appeared to be harming Congress’s ability to govern and undertake formerly uncontentious activities; for instance, the filibuster began to be routinely applied around 2010. They pointed to polarization as a core reason for the malfunctioning of Congress and other democratic institutions.\n\nPolitical scientists began to look into the issue and brought with them the tools of their discipline, which conceived of polarization as ideological distance between policy preferences. To measure that ideological distance in Congress, they used a dataset called DW-Nominate that looked at how members voted.55 Three seminal studies published between 2006 and 2015, including a task force convened by the American Political Science Association, summarized scholarly opinion.56 They found that:\n\nPolarization had risen in the Senate since the mid-1950s and in the House since the mid-1970s (see figure 2). That finding ruled out event-driven polarization such as president Bill Clinton’s impeachment. It also ruled out developments that happened well-after polarization had become entrenched, such as the rise of the right-wing movement known as the Tea Party, which created its own House caucus.57 In the House, the seven states with a single representative (districts that clearly cannot be gerrymandered) also had quite partisan representatives.58 Ideological polarization was highly asymmetric. Republican members of Congress were moving to the right ideologically much faster than Democratic members were moving to the left (see figure 3). Findings on ordinary Americans’ polarization were disputed. Polarization among the public seemed to depend on what scholars were measuring. Pew Research Center found growing antipathy as well as ideological distance among political activists that was bleeding into regular voters, but it also found that a broad center still held.59 Scholars who looked at self-identification found that conservatives were more likely to identify as Republicans and liberals as Democrats, suggesting that the parties were sorting by ideology much more than in past decades. Self-reporting also showed that ideological moderates had declined, and the self-described distance between mainstream Democrats and Republicans (not their respective activist wings) had doubled between 1972 and 2004.60 In fact, voters seemed to have the opposite asymmetry to their representatives: the share of Democrats who claimed to be liberal doubled between 1994 and 2014, and those who were consistently liberal quadrupled. Republican voters did not experience as much movement to the right or consolidation. Pew Research Center speculated that Democratic voters might be consolidating in reaction to Republican members of Congress moving to the right in a highly public way, such as with the release of Gingrich’s Contract With America.61 Scholars also found that voters were more likely to change their positions to match their party affiliation, rather than switching parties to support candidates who supported their positions.62 These findings suggested that the public was also polarizing over policy. However, two of the leading academics in the field of polarization studies, Morris Fiorina of Stanford University and Levendusky, argued strongly that the median voter remained a centrist on most issues.63 They found that Americans held a number of policy beliefs in common despite party affiliation, including on abortion, immigration, and gun rights.64 They also found that a broad group of voters held beliefs from both the left and right of the ideological spectrum and termed these individuals “moderates.” They concluded that Democrats and Republicans who were not political activists held far less unitary views than their own party elites, were more moderate ideologically, and therefore (since polarization was defined as ideological distance), Americans were mostly unpolarized. Their views held sway.\n\nHow Was America Polarized?\n\nScholars drew a number of conclusions from these findings about what was causing polarization and, therefore, what could be done to stop it.\n\nIdeological polarization was an elite issue. Polarization at the congressional level was worrisome but not deadly to democracy. It was causing difficulty with nominations to Congress and with legislation that broke along party lines. But it had not stopped major bipartisan legislation on important issues. Polarization among the American public was occurring, but it was largely among the politically engaged public, which was not the majority. There still seemed to be a broad middle, and there was disagreement about whether polarization even existed.65\n\nWhat Caused Elite Polarization?\n\nCompetition over power was likely to be playing a significant role. Since the country’s founding, congressional power was usually held by one party for decades at a time. But since 1980, it had been more up for grabs than in any period since the Civil War and Reconstruction, leading to more bare-knuckled politics and uglier campaigns as each election could be decisive for congressional control. The Gilded Age was another period in which control of Congress changed parties frequently because each party was close to 50 percent of the voting public. Frances Lee of Princeton University was the main proponent of this theory.66 One book-length study suggested the problem was that as the personal and financial costs of running for office increased and the benefits of holding office decreased, moderate candidates were disproportionately less likely to run, leaving the field to ideological extremes. The study, looking at all candidates who had run for House seats and not just the winners, found that all candidates had polarized significantly since the 1980s—so that whoever won would be more polarized, regardless of voter preferences.67 Further suggesting that the issue was structural and candidate-driven rather than voter-driven, another study found that in 2013, Republican party chairs at the county level preferred extreme candidates by a ten-to-one margin. Democratic party chairs also preferred extreme candidates, by a two-to-one margin. The safety of seats explains why both chairs preferred strong partisans but not why Republicans leaned so much more heavily in that direction.68 The rise in economic inequality in the United States appeared to be causing congressional ideological polarization—but congressional ideological polarization was also leading to increases in inequality, so causality was a vicious circle.69 Nolan McCarty, Keith T. Poole, and Howard Rosenthal found in 2007 that inequality exacerbated ideological polarization, and ideological polarization led to policies that further increased inequality. In other words, they found that people with vastly differential wealth had different policy preferences. But ideological differences between Republican and Democratic partisans led to the failure of redistributive policies, thus exacerbating inequality.70 Religious or evangelical voters were one of many factors—not the driving factor—behind polarization. Religiously driven political polarization was a concern at the time because of the organization of the Moral Majority and post-1980s evangelical movements.71 Gerrymandering was not the problem (in terms of polarization) that democracy activists believed it to be. Since the Senate was also polarized (in fact, had been polarizing for decades before the House had been), as were members who held impossible-to-gerrymander, single-state House districts, gerrymandering could at best be a modest cause of polarization.72 Voter sorting by geography was the greater cause of what looked like geographic polarization. The abolishment of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 may have caused polarization by allowing for greater media partisanship and self-selection into different news silos. When it was in effect, the Fairness Doctrine saw television news as a near monopoly because there were only three major channels, so it required news outlets to provide equal time to different ideological viewpoints; as the number of cable and radio news outlets grew, news appeared to be a more regular private market and president Ronald Reagan’s administration removed this requirement of equal time. That change meant partisans could self-select into media bubbles, while most Americans could opt out of news in favor of entertainment.73\n\n\n\nThere were also concerns that the way the media had started to cover the horse race of politics rather than policy issues led people to be more angered about their losses and that incivility in argumentation in order to increase drama and entertainment value encouraged a more black-and-white view of the world.74 Elite polarization among members of Congress was leading to greater partisan sorting of Americans into separate parties based on their policy preferences. Thus, solving the problems in Congress would help whatever polarization existed among the general public.75\n\nInterventions to Reduce Policy-Based Polarization Among Political Elites\n\nBased on this understanding of polarization, what was then best described as the “good government” field coalesced in the 2010s around the idea that the United States faced a problem of policy-based polarization among political elites. Therefore, many people working in the field of improving American governance concluded that the need was to find ways for Congress to compromise, negotiate, and break partisan incentive structures to win at all costs in order to win ultimate power.\n\nSome efforts were technical alterations to encourage compromise and working together, such as the House Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, a truly bipartisan congressional committee, assisted by outside help, that worked from 2019 to 2022 to improve congressional effectiveness and transparency, as well as other efforts to change congressional rules.\n\nto encourage compromise and working together, such as the House Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, a truly bipartisan congressional committee, assisted by outside help, that worked from 2019 to 2022 to improve congressional effectiveness and transparency, as well as other efforts to change congressional rules. Others were based on altering political incentives to encourage bipartisan cooperation. For instance, the Democratic House majority proposed bringing back earmarks, which allowed legislation to direct congressionally appropriated funds to specific uses in districts. Earmarks had been implicated in corruption and were banned by the Republican House majority in 2011. Yet they also incentivized compromise by giving members something of real worth to trade—taking a vote that could be difficult ideologically or could risk bringing on attack ads by an opponent in the next campaign could be neutralized if a member could show that they had brought home something desired by their district, such as funding for a new health center or bridge. Moreover, by letting members bring valued goods back to their districts, earmarks could show that the government was functioning for the people. 76\n\nFor instance, the Democratic House majority proposed bringing back earmarks, which allowed legislation to direct congressionally appropriated funds to specific uses in districts.

There was a lack of consensus and general skepticism that voting reforms, such as altering primaries, would reduce elite polarization. Fiorina and Levendusky argued that regular Americans were not very polarized. That accorded with findings in many other countries that partisan polarization tended to be an elite problem that had little effect on regular voters. If voters were more moderate than politicians, then electorates were not causing the polarization in Congress and electoral reform would not help. 77 Few reformers paid attention to the findings on candidates and how candidate incentives might be influenced by beliefs about campaigning and fundraising.\n\nFew reformers paid attention to the findings on candidates and how candidate incentives might be influenced by beliefs about campaigning and fundraising. The problem of growing inequality fit the data for when ideological polarization began in both chambers of Congress, but the good government field at the time generally paid little attention to economics.\n\nSecond Generation Understanding: Mass Affective Polarization\n\nPolarization Is Emotional Dislike Based on Identity That Affects Regular People\n\nBy 2016, experts were struggling to describe a landscape that appeared to have high mass public polarization, despite the fact that many scholars continued to find a great deal of overlap among Americans’ policy views on contentious issues.78\n\nScholars from new disciplines, such as political psychology and comparative politics, started to formulate a new hypothesis about what was occurring in the United States and other polarized democracies. Working separately and writing in hundreds of papers and books, these scholars crafted what became known as the idea of affective polarization:emotional dislike and disgust between members of opposing parties based not on policies but on identity.79 Partisans who were affectively polarized might actually overlap in their policy views (without knowing it due to misperceptions), or they might differ; policy alignment was not a good measure of emotional feelings.80 As political psychologist Lilliana Mason argued, “identity-based ideology can drive affective ideological polarization even when individuals are naïve about policy. The passion and prejudice with which we approach politics is driven not only by what we think, but also powerfully by who we think we are.”81 In some cases, differences in policy beliefs even appeared to shrink as affective polarization increased.82 Using measures based not on what policies people supported but on feeling thermometers ranking “warmth” or “coolness” toward the other party, trust and trait measures (such as asking if the other party was more hypocritical or more trustworthy), and social distance measures (such as “would you mind if your child married a member of the opposite party” and spousal agreement on party),83 scholars attempted to understand the public’s emotional state.\n\nScholars claimed that affective polarization was more destabilizing than policy polarization because it wove itself into a country’s social fabric. Different studies drew implications for the economy,84 health,85 and democracy itself. In particular, affective polarization seemed to allow one’s own political side to get away with undemocratic behavior to prevent the other side from winning, enabling the election of leaders who harmed democracy with the support of their base voters.\n\nThe international peace-building organization Beyond Conflict found that Republicans and Democrats who overestimated the degree of dehumanization, dislike, and disagreement between parties were more likely to support putting their political party over the general good of the country. They also found lower levels of trust in the country’s civic institutions, such as local and state governments or the Supreme Court, among those who overestimated the affective polarization of the other side. 86\n\nA survey of American voters found that they were less willing to support same-day voter registration if they were told that it would primarily benefit the other party. 87\n\nStudies by Milan Svolik and coauthors found in lab experiments in Türkiye, the United States, and Venezuela that the most polarized voters were the most willing to turn a blind eye to antidemocratic behavior committed by their party in order to prevent opponents from gaining control because they feared subversion by the other side.88 Actual voting data showed that Americans were willing to trade democratic principles for partisan loyalty or policy preferences and that only a small portion of Americans would prioritize democracy when these goals came into conflict.89 An online experiment by Alia Braley and coauthors with nearly 2,000 Americans found that voters were particularly willing to allow democratic norm-breaking by their side if they were credibly concerned that the other side wanted to break the rules—similar to the security dilemmas faced by countries locked in potential future conflict, where the incentive is to attack first if one fears being attacked.90\n\nHow Was America Polarized?\n\nThe American public is affectively polarized today, and affective polarization has been increasing steadily since the 1980s and possibly earlier, depending on the measurement used. (For one such measurement, see figure 4, based on data modeled by Massachusetts Institute of Technology election expert Charles Stewart III.) Since at least the mid-1990s, affective polarization had been growing for all age groups, but it had grown most quickly among people over sixty-five.91 Affective polarization is being driven primarily by dislike of the other party rather than positive feelings toward one’s own, since positive feelings toward one’s own party has also dropped slightly since the late 1980s (see upper lines in figure 4). Republicans reported liking their own party more in 2016, in correlation with the MAGA movement. Affective polarization, however, is quite symmetric across the parties.92 Affective polarization appears to be largely driven by misperceptions. Misperceptions about the actual demographic identities of the other party, the policy beliefs held by members of the other party, how much members of the other party disliked and disagreed with the respondents, and whether members of the other party supported democratic norm-breaking are all driving the problem.93 While the public feels a great deal of emotional dislike and polarization between the parties, ideological divergence in the mass public has not increased greatly over time.94 It is increasing somewhat: liberals are becoming more liberal on social issues and Democrats have moved to the left on racial issues since 2010, while Republicans have largely remained in the same place. Meanwhile, under the Biden administration, Republicans have started to move right on immigration.95 Yet most scholarship continues to agree with earlier findings that there is significant ideological overlap and agreement on policies, including on contentious issues such as guns and abortion, in part because there is a lot of ideological inconsistency in the parties—particularly with the move of a group of conservative but economically redistributive former swing voters into the Republican Party in 2016.96 However, it is worth noting that most Americans do not hold very intense policy beliefs; for many years, scholars have found that American voters alter their policy preferences to match their partisan identities. In contrast to Congress, which appears to be ideologically polarized, the problem for the public seems to be emotional rather than ideological—though some of the emotional polarization is based on real and perceived ideological differences among the activist edges of each party. Affective polarization has been rising much more rapidly in the United States than in most other Western countries (see figure 5). Attitudes across countries are notoriously hard to measure and compare; different systems of evaluation have yielded different measurements even when using the same data. However, most scholars agreed that America’s overall level of affective polarization, though rising, was only middling when compared with other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). A number of peer democracies with multiparty systems had higher levels of affective polarization but were showing much less democratic strain.97 That finding suggests that if affective polarization is harming U.S. democracy, it is not acting alone but is being exacerbated by other factors, such as the structure of the U.S. political system or the media environment.\n\n\n\nTrends in affective polarization also look very different across OECD democracies—rising in some, falling in others, and sometimes staying the same. That suggests that the United States’ swift rise in affective polarization has a domestic cause rather than being caused by an internationally systemic issue.\n\n\n\nScholars such as McCoy and Murat Somer have very different findings based on a different way of looking at polarization. Their measurement of “pernicious polarization” not only includes affective polarization but also considers whether the process of polarization has collapsed a variety of identities into two opposing camps that view each other with so much distaste, othering, and aversion that each group sees the other as immoral. It further considers whether politicians are using polarization as an instrumental strategy. Viewing polarization as a process rather than just an amount of dislike provides a way of measuring how hardened polarization is likely to be and whether there are negative feedback loops between public emotions and political incentives that create a fundamentally different environment than can be gauged by a single snapshot of mass feeling. Using this definition and measures based on expert opinion rather than self-reported feelings, their research finds that the United States is polarized at extraordinary rates compared to other countries and that no other wealthy, consolidated democracy has been as perniciously polarized for as long as the United States.98 This observation may be incorrect, as the expert data is subject to a presentism bias (since the measure was created recently and coded for past years). But it may also be more accurate than self-reported feeling thermometers because different countries report their feelings differently (that is, what feels like intense polarization to a Swede might feel quite mild to an American) and because their underlying definition of polarization is a better measure of antidemocratic attitudes than affective polarization alone.\n\nWhat Has Been Causing Affective Polarization?\n\nTheories of what has been driving affective polarization draw from psychology, sociology, comparative democracy, and political science. Each discipline sees the problem through the lenses it brings to the world. The problem could have many causes—there is no reason to believe it is only one. There is also no reason to believe that the same cause affects both parties equally—they could each be affectively polarized for different reasons. A number of theories that are common among the public are not supported by research. Eight major theories or explanatory narratives have emerged in recent years.\n\nStacked and sorted identities. People’s brains are wired to form in-groups for safety and then use shortcuts based on shared values, stories, symbols, and language to decide who is in and who is out. It is possible to prefer one’s own group without feeling much antagonism for an out-group (known as “in-group affinity”). But human brains are constantly scanning for threats to in-groups. As people affectively polarize, they appear to blow out-group threats out of proportion, exaggerating the out-group’s dislike and disgust for their own group and getting ready to defend their in-group, sometimes aggressively. Once polarization starts, it can become a vicious cycle because the human tendency toward motivated cognition seeks out information that proves these exaggerated beliefs and discounts information inconsistent with those beliefs.99 Mason and other scholars claim that polarization entered this cycle in the United States because of increasingly well-sorted parties. Americans have sorted themselves into parties based on their ideological affinities (meaning there are fewer liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats) at the same time that other racial, religious, sexual, geographic, and cultural identities have been increasingly aligned with partisanship.100 This “stacking” of identities within each party has allowed partisanship to become a social identity, not just a marker of one’s policy preferences.101 People with stacked identities are quicker to take offense when any of their identities are perceived to be maligned. So these in- and out-group dynamics are operating at high sensitivity, in which a threat against any one of many stacked identities can be perceived as an attack against one’s group.102 Geographic and social sorting. Other scholars point to people sorting into more homogenous groups of friends and geographic sorting,103 two factors that are leading people to socialize more with people they already agree with.104 Partisans may have incidentally self-sorted into different geographies because of preferences for urban or rural living or other factors. After that, they socialize with copartisans and their beliefs deepen as a result of that social homogeneity. This is not the same as self-sorting purposefully with the primary goal of living among copartisans, for which there are anecdotal claims but evidence is unclear. Mobility data and voter records suggest that people are moving because of other issues, such as jobs or the quality of public schools.105 However, these could be linked to partisan identity and ideology (that is, what one views as a quality school may differ based on ideology, or one could look for a job in another state because the laws in one’s current state feel threatening). Media bubbles. Another common claim is that Americans are sorting themselves into media echo chambers whose lack of balanced content further radicalizes and polarizes them.106 Social media is particularly singled out for its negative effects because its algorithms and business models have been shown to exacerbate outrage and anger.107 Social media has also been found to help recruit and provide platforms to extremists.108 However, scholarship is extremely mixed regarding the effects of social media.109 Four recent landmark studies by dozens of researchers conducting tests on tens of thousands of Facebook and Instagram accounts found that social media algorithms did not affect users’ polarization.110 While scholarship points in multiple directions, those findings support the preponderance of empirical studies that suggest, insofar as social media may be exacerbating affective polarization, the problem is small. And, the problem is not social media alone but the country’s entire media system. A recent literature review into media and social media in the United States found that media in general was likely increasing ideological and affective polarization. (It also noted significant methodological issues in the literature, particularly an overreliance on Twitter to measure social media usage, which is a problem because Twitter’s user demographics are not those of the median voter).111 Most studies do not find much correlation between internet news or social media use and affective polarization. That may be because most Americans do not use social media to discuss politics; politics is a very incidental part of life for most Americans, who largely avoid it.112 Scholars find that internet usage has increased similarly across Western Europe and in OECD countries, but affective polarization has skyrocketed in the United States while it has shown no consistent trend across OECD countries. Another cross-country study found that online news is slightly negatively correlated with affective polarization across countries—Americans get far less news online than Norwegians or Swedes, for instance, but affective polarization is rising in the United States while declining in the two other countries.113 Other studies argue that the internet only became a significant part of news in the 2000s, yet affective polarization has been growing since at least the 1980s and correlates more closely with the rise of cable news.114 (However, affective polarization from Democrats seems to have experienced a sharper rise since the early 2000s; see figure 6.) A large-scale experiment in which individuals deactivated their Facebook accounts for four weeks prior to the 2018 midterm elections did find that the deactivation reduced affective polarization, but only slightly.115 Meanwhile, affective polarization is growing most quickly among Americans over sixty-five years old. Yet younger Americans use more social media than older adults, while those over sixty-five spend more than six and a half hours a day in front of their televisions.116 Social media remains a problem for polarization, but in context. Multiple studies show that most Americans are not seeking out political news on social media, and so the loose connections they get through social media actually tend to bring them into connection with less polarizing news, rather than amplifying media bubbles. However, for the small segment of the public that is highly engaged with politics, social media is probably polarizing.117 Since nearly everyone running or funding efforts to reduce polarization is, by definition, highly engaged with politics, this group may overstate the effects of social media versus the entire media environment. Meanwhile, for violent individuals, particular sites are used for organizing, though the degree of radicalization occurring through those sites is unclear. In the United States, surveys (such as one by Public Religion Research Institute) find more intense and consistent negative democratic effects from far-right and right-wing cable news and radio companies and channels, such as Newsmax, One America News, and Fox News, rather than social media.118 Exposure to these offline forms of partisan news makes those with extreme attitudes even more extreme.119 Only one-tenth of insurrectionists arrested after the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol received most of their news from social media; most favored conservative television and radio.120 An experiment in which people were incentivized to shift from watching Fox News to CNN showed that further exposure to partisan outlets, such as Fox News, was radicalizing and that incentivizing a shift from Fox to CNN led to more accurate and less polarized information.121 But causation is unclear: people who are more polarized might also be more motivated to watch partisan news. After Fox News made an early call during the November 2020 election that the majority of Arizonans had voted for Biden for president, 37 percent of the network’s prime-time viewers chose to move their viewership temporarily to more extreme outlets, such as Newsmax and One America News, that reported for months that a Trump victory was possible (or had actually occurred). Viewers were shaping the content, rather than being led by it.122 Similarly, after Fox News fired its most popular host, the right-wing personality Tucker Carlson, viewership plummeted—while viewership increased during the same period at Newsmax.123 More polarized people may also be more motivated to engage with polarizing social media. Studies of YouTube showed that most engagement with extremist content was largely confined to a small, concentrated group of people who had preexisting, negative views on gender and race.124 And while partisan traditional news sources do seem to exacerbate polarization in America, in Europe there is little evidence to suggest that exposure to partisan or populist traditional media causes widespread polarization.125 It could be that social media and partisan traditional media are having more polarizing effects in America than elsewhere because of other factors. For instance, having a trusted media source—whether a national source of record or a strong local news source—might mitigate the polarizing effects of social and partisan media. In the United States, no single news source is trusted by more than 50 percent of Americans, while in the United Kingdom, for example, 86 percent of Britons say that they are satisfied with their state broadcasting service.126 Countries that spend more on public broadcasting have seen greater decreases in polarization, though the direction of causality is unclear.127 In the United States, it is possible that local news played the mediating, trusted role that a government broadcaster plays in some other democracies and that the decline of local news is enhancing affective polarization. One study found that after communities lost a local newspaper, voters were less likely to split their ticket in federal elections.128 The decline of local news has also been linked to lower voter turnout and citizen engagement in general.129 Inequality and economics. While ideological polarization in Congress is correlated with inequality, inequality’s relationship with affective polarization is much less clear—in part because there are very few studies on it. One multicountry study found that high inequality and unemployment were correlated with greater affective polarization; however, another study using the same data but a different evaluation method found that the role of inequality no longer held. 130\n\nOther studies looking across countries suggest that inequality is poorly correlated with affective polarization. For instance, affective polarization has been falling in Australia at the same time as inequality has been rising, while affective polarization is rising quickly in Denmark while income inequality is quite low. In the Netherlands, affective polarization is growing relatively swiftly while income inequality is also low (though wealth inequality is higher). 131\n\nIn Belgium, affective polarization is distributed quite differently in different parts of the country. One study found that differences in economic performance over the past few years drove affective polarization, particularly if wealthier areas were located near poorer places. But the rural/urban divide also still mattered, separate from these dynamics. 132\n\nOne theoretical model suggests that inequality could contribute to polarization by encouraging people who are more risk averse due to a harder economic environment to limit their interactions to in-group members.133 Low levels of social trust are associated with these people being more risk averse and retreating to doing business within their in-group.134 But if inequality is having these effects, its role needs to be teased out from other factors that could be lowering social trust. Economic shocks. Some research suggests that calamitous economic shocks—such as the Great Depression and the 2008–2009 financial crisis—increase support for populist parties that denigrate social out-groups and thus cause affective polarization.135 However, globally, populist parties began winning power in 2000, prior to the 2008–2009 financial crisis, though the crisis may have increased their success: populist leaders hit their modern peak in 2018. If economic shocks are exacerbating affective polarization by leading voters to elect populist candidates, then inequality is mediated through populist political leaders who interpret economic realities and is not a direct cause. Michael Podhorzer’s analysis of majority-White congressional districts showed that after the 2008–2009 financial crisis, the majority-White districts that voted Republican (prior to or after the shock) had a much slower economic recovery than those that voted for Democrats (see figure 7).136 These trends in recovery strongly correlate with rural-versus-urban geographies (see figure 8).137 Affective polarization among the American public had started long before 2008. But these trends—given direction by a concerted effort at political organizing by deep-pocketed donors—could explain the rise of the Tea Party, which firmly moved affective polarization from a feeling into a political force that led to candidates getting elected. These are the ways in which emotion, mediated by political incentives and politicians, can create changes to democracy. Another financial shock that may have played a role is the rise in Chinese imports, which, according to one study, reduced U.S. manufacturing jobs and increased unemployment, particularly among non-college-educated groups.138 Meanwhile, the regions most affected by reduced employment due to Chinese imports shifted their media viewing toward Fox News. Majority-White regions most affected by the substitution of Chinese imports for local jobs were more likely to elect a Republican congressperson and majority-minority regions a Democratic one.139 Racial resentment. People holding hostile attitudes toward racial minorities had been found within both parties throughout the twentieth century. They began moving to the Republican Party after the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The 2016 election was another punctuation point, when a new group of voters scoring high on racial resentment moved from being Democrats or swing voters into the Republican Party.140 A study of 5,000 Americans conducted throughout the 2016 election found that White Trump supporters adopted more racially hostile views toward Black Americans over the course of the campaign in line with their preferred candidate’s rhetoric.141 Nathan Kalmoe and Mason found that White Republicans with higher levels of minority resentment were also more likely to see Democrats as evil or subhuman—that is, to be affectively polarized.142 These alterations coincided with Republicans holding a more racialized view of the Democratic Party (thinking of the party as containing a larger number of minorities than was accurate).143 Meanwhile, for approximately a decade, Democrats had been moving to the left on racial issues.144 Status anxiety. Economics and race may work together to create a sense of fear and othering. The idea that fear of economic scarcity exacerbates racism is corroborated by experiments showing that in a lab context, White Americans primed to be thinking about economic scarcity reduce resource allocations to Black Americans.145 The problem may be linked to the idea of relative deprivation: when individuals feel deprived of success they had anticipated achieving or felt they deserved, they can experience a sense that they deserve better than their current situation and that someone else is to blame.146 Usually these grievances must be articulated and exploited by a conflict entrepreneur or political leader, and until that person or movement comes along, structural inequality per se does not move people into extremism. Consider again the rise of the Tea Party. As voters face greater economic precarity in general, particularly following a shock, they become more attuned to further threats and are more sensitive to political appeals that out-group members are supposedly taking their rightful place. Affective polarization grows because of the confluence of economic precarity, status threat, and the existence of a leader or common narrative that blames the situation on particular people or causes. The need for other factors to interact with economics may be why other markers such as living in poverty, being working class, being unemployed, and fearing economic loss do not correlate with support for nativist or xenophobic parties in the United States or Europe.147 Some research suggests that nativism (which is not the same as affective polarization but is potentially linked) may be most attractive to those doing less well relative to others within a growing economy—even if those individuals are doing better than they previously had been. For instance, many of the poorest European countries have not seen a major rise in nativist parties, while countries with relatively high employment and prosperity (such as Austria and the Netherlands), as well as regions with expanding economies and employment (such as Saxony and Brandenburg in Germany), have seen rising nativism.148 Poverty also has no correlation with political violence.149 In fact, domestic terrorists are, if anything, slightly better educated and more wealthy than other Americans.150 Politicians and political incentives. Other scholars pointed to the particular role of political leaders and structural incentives in stoking affective, identity-based polarization to win elections. The literature suggests three mechanisms. Personality or individual-level explanations: The rise of populist leaders suggested some politicians’ personalities led them to use polarization as their means to create intense ties to their voting base and thus win elections. 151 For instance, countries such as Brazil and Poland, which were previously fairly unpolarized, polarized quickly during the campaigns and under the governments of populist leaders. Meanwhile, in Hungary, a politician drew on old but long-submerged fissures to scapegoat portions of society (which did not exactly polarize because there were not many minorities to form the other “pole”). 152\n\nFor instance, countries such as Brazil and Poland, which were previously fairly unpolarized, polarized quickly during the campaigns and under the governments of populist leaders.

Structural incentives: Others pointed to political incentives in both places with close races where control over power was under dispute and in places with first-past-the-post, winner-take-all systems in which moving a tiny number of voters might give a politician a total win over a district or country. 153 Majoritarian systems seem to favor affective polarization by creating a binary of political actors. 154 For this reason, political scientists have recommended a broad array of structural changes to America’s two-party, winner-take-all system to affect these incentives. 155\n\nMajoritarian systems seem to favor affective polarization by creating a binary of political actors. For this reason, political scientists have recommended a broad array of structural changes to America’s two-party, winner-take-all system to affect these incentives. Campaign incentives: Negative campaigns also seemed to play a role. Across recent election cycles, voters were 50–150 percent more affectively polarized by Election Day than they were a year earlier. Political advertisements, especially negative advertising, had particularly strong effects on affective polarization.156\n\nInterventions to Reduce Affective Polarization\n\nThese findings led to a diverse set of early experiments to bring down affective polarization. Four strands of such work have received the most scholarship.\n\nCorrect misperceptions about the other party, one-on-one or through broader awareness campaigns. Since people who are affectively polarized are known to hold erroneous beliefs and perceptions about the other party, one path that initially appeared promising was correcting these misbeliefs. Correct misperceptions based on identity. Democrats tend to think Republicans are wealthier, older, and more evangelical than they are (for instance, believing that over a third of Republicans earned over $250,000 when the reality is 2 percent), while Republicans think Democrats are more often members of unions and more likely to be atheists, sexual minorities, or people of color (for instance, believing that nearly a third of Democrats were members of the LGBT community while the reality is six percent). Like ideological misperceptions, these demographic misbeliefs are strongest among those who are more politically informed. They increase the feeling that the average member of the other group has little in common with themselves and increase animus. 157 In fact, the modal member of both parties is a middle-aged, White, nonevangelical Christian. In one set of lab experiments, scholars found that when respondents’ misperceptions about the demographics of the other party were corrected, affective polarization decreased. 158 Because many people hold biases against the other party’s stereotypical groups, correcting these biases back to the modal member helps—though done without care, correcting misperceptions can further the implicit connection between Whiteness, Christianity, and heterosexuality with “Americanness” (see the discussion in point 2). 159\n\nCorrect misperceptions based on policies. People who are affectively polarized may dislike one another and be unaware that their policy beliefs overlap. Multiple studies found that when partisans were made aware that they shared policy beliefs across parties, their affective polarization declined.160 This finding suggested that although affective polarization is emotional, it may still have a strong policy basis and thus could be changed by correcting misperceptions about policies supported by the other side. Some studies found that issue positions influenced feelings about the other party more than partisanship. If voters learned they shared the same policy beliefs, they rated each other more warmly. Those feelings cooled if they learned they were in different parties, but they were still warmer than feelings toward copartisans who held different political beliefs.161 Another study, part of Stanford University’s Strengthening Democracy Challenge, found that watching a short video in which Democrats and Republicans discovered they shared more common ground than they previously believed reduced affective polarization.162 Increase the salience of a common identity. Multiple studies suggested that efforts to create a “superordinate identity,” or a common, overarching identity, could reduce affective polarization. The “one-group” model emphasizes a shared identity that encapsulates members of all groups. For instance, Levendusky used the Fourth of July to prime American identity and the killing of Osama bin Laden to prime a common threat. He found emphasizing these things that Americans share could reduce partisan animus.163 This was in keeping with other studies that have consistently found that emphasizing a shared, single group membership reduces intergroup bias.164 However, America’s partisan polarization is interwoven with racial identity, creating an important caveat. Some scholarship has found that subordinating minority identity to a common identity (that is, “we are all Americans”) makes minorities less interested in engaging over time.165 Even if minority individuals are willing to engage in the intervention program, they tend to reassert their minority or subgroup identities, often with some intensity.166 As minority individuals reassert their minority identities (such as claiming that language like “we are all Americans” risks erasing the specific histories of their groups), other people in the intervention may respond with an increase in bias (for instance, feeling that the strong assertion of minority identity is the reason Americans cannot get along).167 Other scholars worry that insofar as creating a superordinate American identity does reduce polarization, it may do so by further associating American identity with Whiteness. Not only could such associations exclude minorities from American identity, but also, the implicit connection between race and American identity could enhance divides as the United States transitions to a country with an increasing proportion of minorities. In other words, so long as the modal member of both parties is White, increasing the salience of American identity reduces partisan prejudice. But efforts to create a single identity can implicitly engage race: for instance, asking people to recall the imagery of America’s founding may implicitly call to mind images of White people. If there is a mismatch between the concept of American identity as White and the actual composition of the opposing party, increasing the salience of American identity could actually correlate with higher levels of partisan hostility.168 For these reasons, scholars have tried interventions that emphasize both a common American identity and other identities. A 2011 study found that this “dual identity” approach maintained the willingness of disadvantaged groups to engage.169 A 2013 study found that this dual identity approach enabled majority groups to recognize and decrease prejudice against minority groups in America, and studies of other countries showed it worked in reducing prejudice.170 Bring groups together to have social relationships across difference.171 Often called “bridging programs,” these interventions are based on a tradition of intergroup contact theory that dates back to the 1960s and was developed predominantly in reaction to America’s racial divide. In the United States, programs usually bring people together who self-identify as Republican or Democratic to talk across that divide, often to talk about the divide or about divisions on policy issues. Years of scholarship show that programs like these can reduce prejudice if they are very well moderated.172 However, a 2021 meta-analysis of the extensive literature on intergroup contact theory found serious limitations in applying this theory to political polarization.173 The majority of the studies were conducted with young adults and teenagers, whose identities are still in formation, but interventions are being applied to older adults whose identities are fully formed. Studies largely focused on overcoming prejudice based on characteristics that individuals are born into, such as race and religion, but there is no evidence that the theory continues to work when applied to political identities that people choose and that they may be held morally culpable for holding. Most studies were too small to know whether they could scale. Meanwhile, evidence suggests that these programs work only under tightly circumscribed conditions: for instance, participants across a divide must be of the same economic class. If these programs are run poorly or preconditions are not met, they can backfire and deepen bias. Make structural alterations to electoral systems. A number of scholars have suggested an array of structural alterations to electoral systems. These are sometimes framed as a way to reduce affective polarization but are more commonly discussed as a way to reduce political incentives to polarize the public or to reduce the likelihood of more extreme partisans or antidemocratic personalities getting elected. Intervention suggestions include forms of proportional representation, such as requiring states with more than a minimum number of districts to elect half of their congressional delegations by individual districts and the other half at large, whether from the entire state at large or from larger, nongerrymandered regions;174 abolishing primaries or making primaries nonpartisan, in which all candidates run and the top two vote getters qualify for the general election;175 instituting ranked choice voting, which is supported both for its possible effects in getting around polarizing primaries and because it may reduce negative campaigning based on a study by the advocacy organization FairVote;176 and finally, setting up proportional representation systems, which allows a broader spectrum of political options to gain representation and ensures that no significant percentage of the population fails to get represented because it represents a minority within a given geography in the way winner-take-all systems allow.177\n\nThird Generation Understanding: Cracks in the Foundations\n\nReducing Affective Polarization May Not Impact Violent or Antidemocratic Attitudes\n\nMore recent data, however, has introduced some core challenges for any interventions that are intended to reduce affective polarization alone.\n\nA number of recent studies have found that interventions to decrease affective polarization can change participants’ feelings toward members of the other party. But they don’t seem to affect the antidemocratic or violent attitudes and behaviors that were supposedly being caused by affective polarization.178\n\nA study of the interventions in Stanford’s Strengthening Democracy Challenge (which tested short, online interventions on 30,000 participants) found that many of the lab interventions reduced partisan animosity immediately, and some effects even persisted two weeks later.179 But the interventions did not reduce antidemocratic attitudes or justifications for political violence. In fact, one intervention that was based on creating a shared identity as an “exhausted majority” actually increased support for antidemocratic practices. Meanwhile, a video that graphically depicted social instability and violence in collapsing democracies around the world reduced affective polarization while increasing conservative Republican support for political violence (possibly because it included footage of January 6).180 A separate study by an overlapping group of researchers used three completely different tests on the findings from the Strengthening Democracy Challenge. They also found that interventions that reduced affective polarization in lab environments did not seem to affect antidemocratic attitudes.181 A third study with different researchers conducted five different lab-based tests and agreed that affective polarization is linked to how people feel interpersonally about the other party’s members, but it is not related to their support for partisan views, policy positions, or democratic norms, nor is it related to how people react to actual information about their real representatives and other tested political effects.182\n\nStepping back from the interventions, these scholars also looked at whether affective polarization was even correlated with antidemocratic attitudes or political violence. They found that social distrust, partisan animosity, and biased evaluation of politicized facts (all hallmarks of affective polarization) did group together. But these factors were not correlated closely with support for undemocratic practices, political violence, and undemocratic candidates, and interventions that affected the first set of variables that characterize affective polarization did not necessarily affect the second set of variables, which were what researchers ultimately wanted to change.183 Subsequent testing by an overlapping group of researchers using different tests found that there was no reliable correlation between affective polarization and antidemocratic attitudes or political violence.184 These findings echo the literature review on intergroup contact theory, which showed that bridging programs can be successful at changing the feelings of the people who participate but provided no evidence that changing such feelings will affect individuals’ actual behaviors, such as voting for antidemocratic candidates or supporting political violence.185\n\nAntidemocratic Attitudes\n\nA few interventions within the Strengthening Democracy Challenge were found to reduce both affective polarization and antidemocratic attitudes. These were interventions that reassured participants that the other side was not going to undermine democracy itself.\n\nOne intervention that reduced antidemocratic attitudes was a video showing Utah’s gubernatorial candidates from both parties committing themselves to honor the results of the 2020 election. Another program corrected misperceptions about the other party’s willingness to engage in antidemocratic behaviors, such as reducing the number of polling stations, refusing to accept election results, or using violence to block laws.186\n\nLearning that partisans on the other side were not so bent on playing dirty and destroying democracy reduced support for antidemocratic actions from one’s own side.187 That intervention found support from other scholars who showed that voter decisions to support an antidemocratic candidate seem sensible if they think the harm from their decision is small while the consequences of the opposition winning are catastrophic to democracy.188 These findings by scholars such as Svolik previously cited affective polarization as a cause, but in fact, they could be right about their empirical findings but wrong about the cause. Newer research suggests that the problem is not general feelings of dislike for the other party but instead specific fears that the other party will undermine democracy.\n\nPolitical Violence\n\nThe data do not support the idea that affective polarization directly causes political violence. In fact, justifying political violence seems separate from both affective polarization and antidemocratic attitudes. That makes sense given what is known about violence; the literature suggests it has much more to do with personality and self-control than emotions or ideology.\n\nIn addition to the lab tests and survey responses already described that show a lack of correlation between attitudes supporting political violence and affective polarization, other facts do not match. For instance, Democrats are about equally affectively polarized as Republicans. In fact, from 2017 to 2020—the years for which Kalmoe and Mason published survey data—political violence justifications were nearly as common (and sometimes more preval", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/05"}]}

You see this in women’s gymnastics as well or really any other sport where being young is an advantage. For example, if one elite girl is 16y and 364 days at the cutoff whereas another is 17y and 1 day, you end up in a situation where the latter has to wait until she’s almost 21 and may never make it (especially in a competitive country) but the former can compete at what is her “peak” in the sport.

Interestingly Ice dancing has gone from my least favorite figure skating event to my favorite purely because the singles events truly feel like robots just trying to accrue points from some rubric. Perhaps instead of just having an age limit they should instead ban quads, or further limit the number of jumps, or say that every quad you do reduces by 1 the total number of jumps you can do? Skating right now feels like a jump fest where everyone is trying to see how small they can be to hit as many insane jumps as possible. It’s actually made it more boring to a casual viewer like me.

China is a great country with an immensely rich heritage and equally prodigious potential, and we shouldn't let its power-hungry despots distract us from the fact that their iron rule does not define the country or its people.But let's be real, when historians write about the Beijing Winter Olympics years from now there will be one dark cloud that hangs over everything else:Something will have to give. Like you I'm also something of an Olympics junkie who has followed every Summer Games almost from start to finish since Atlanta (except Rio, when the world was about to turn into crap), and every Winter Games since Torino/Turin, and nothing has ever made me as emotionally drained (to quote Jen Psaki) as that Tutberidze Girls bloodbath. The collective failures of these alphabet agencies were exposed in just about the most spectacular fashion, and while there's something ghoulish about the world finally paying attention to injustice due to a pretty White girl rather than a whole ethnic minority or even a whole nation, sometimes that's precisely what it takes to change a sclerotic system.As that AP piece notes raising the limit to 18 would make quads impossible for all but the most freakish women, so it definitely can and must be part of the package. I'm partial to boosting artistic components myself, though that will certainly draw howls about how subjective and biased the judging has become.Mind you (real) change won't come easy. I still remember, well before Karolyi became a dirty name, explaining to my e-buds that what happens to young (female) gymnasts is borderline child abuse - of course I'd now drop that \"borderline\" - but nobody seemed to give a hoot. And this wasn't a gang of flaming right-wingers, but mostly progs and liberal-leaning people who generally care a lot about social justice. Basically it's the gymnastics/figure skating equivalent of why (American) football and hockey fans pay little heed to concussions and possible long-term brain damage incurred by their favorite players: we enjoy them competing in our favorite sports, and nobody is forcing them so that's that.And even I wasn't very sympathetic when Biles pulled out of individual events (save balance beam) last time. In my defense I didn't know \"twisties\" is a thing among gymnasts, but the winning-is-everything mentality is so ingrained in our minds it's no wonder Russia among others is willing to resort to child abuse if it results in hardware. And pulling these children out of (senior) competition altogether? You can already imagine the level of pushback we're likely to see.LOL, I was just responding in kind to our Canadian nationalist grandpa. No need to take it too seriously.Speaking of who:Tells us how much/little you know. Women's hockey is even less competitive than women's soccer/football, and NHL players haven't joined the men's field for 2 straight Os now. Oh, and the '10 gold medal match between you Canucks and the Yanks was a ratings bonanza on both sides of the border:And we all know you'd be singing a different tune with your homeboy/girl winning an individual medal.

Why? She is 15. It's 'fundamental' fairness | 3 ...", "text": "As this column — alone from the start in the western press — has outlined, the key to the matter is that Valieva is 15. Thus, per the 2021 version of the World Anti-Doping Code, that makes her a “protected person.” A “protected person” is someone who is not yet 16. Under the rules, a “protected person” has special status when it comes to what she (or he) might have to prove, or not, and what penalties she might get, or maybe even not.\n\nTo be clear, there are different sets of rules at the Olympics for different things. One set relates to age-related eligibility to compete; for figure skating, those are set by the International Skating Union. Doping rules across the board, no matter the sport, are governed by the World Anti-Doping Code. The current edition of the Code took effect on Jan. 1, 2021. That’s where you find “protected person.”\n\nValieva tested positive Dec. 25 for trimetazidine, a drug used to treat angina, a heart condition. The level has not been made public. A trace? Who knows? The sample was not returned by the Stockholm lab until Feb. 8. That is the day after — Feb. 7 — her skate helped the ROC win gold in the team competition.\n\nOn Feb. 9, a Russian Anti-Doping Agency, or RUSADA, commission lifted a provisional suspension. With time of the essence, CAS met Sunday and issued a ruling at 2 p.m. Beijing time today, the 14th. The individual event begins at 6 p.m. tomorrow, the 15th. Valieva, who can throw quads the way the rest of us breathe through K95 masks, is a favorite.\n\nThe ruling Monday noted that the facts in the matter remain “very limited.”\n\nIt also went on, first beat, to underscore her status as a “protected person,” with those different standards.\n\nIt then declared it would cause Valieva “irreparable harm in these circumstances” not to be able to compete — after taking into account “fundamental principles of fairness, proportionality, irreparable harm and the relative balance of interests,” making a point to note that she, one, has not tested positive in-competition here at the Games and, two, is 100% at some point down the road going to have to go through a full hearing on the merits.\n\nWith that in mind, it also offered clues about the direction of that hearing — saying there were “serious issues of untimely notification of the results” of her Dec. 25 test, it not being reported until the day after she had competed, “which impinged upon [her] ability to establish certain legal requirements for her benefit, while such late notification was not her fault, in the middle of the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022.” [emphasis mine]\n\nLater Tuesday, the IOC announced that if Valieva medals in the individual event, there will be no medals or flowers at the women’s individual event at these 2022 Games. Because, of course. What else?\n\nBack to the CAS statement: nowhere, of course, did the panel say anything about “state-sanctioned doping.”\n\nWhy would it?\n\nIt was not at issue.\n\nTo read the press, to watch the TV, to hear the politicking from U.S. Olympic leaders, you surely would have thought it was.\n\nSo this must be said:\n\nAll this discourse, this bombast, has been a disservice, and on so many levels.\n\nThis matter is not — repeat, not — a matter of Russia, Russia, Russia, bad, bad, bad.\n\nThis is, always was, a matter of a 15-year-old girl entitled to due process and fairness.\n\nIf it was you — if it was your 15-year-old — if it was an American 15-year-old — in the dock, all of you with your outrage would be screaming for due process and fairness.\n\nThere’s no assertion that the Swedish lab was in on anything. This case is a vivid reminder that anyone anywhere — American, say — can be one missing FedEx shipment away from catastrophe. One pandemic-stricken lab away from chaos. One bureaucratic foul-up away from disruption.\n\nAnd there’s always a real person at the center of things.\n\nEveryone — anyone, everyone, especially a 15-year-old girl, unable under any western legal notion of offering an adult formation of “intent” — is innocent until proven otherwise.\n\nAs Sting once memorably reminded us in song, the Russians love their children, too.\n\nFurther: if two years of death and illness amid a global pandemic has taught us anything, it is that we need more empathy in our world, not less. More of the aspirational ideal of the Olympics.\n\nLess politicking and hypocritical, sanctimonious, righteous nationalism.\n\nTo quote one of the hardest hard-liners of the moralist anti-doping crusaders, Bill Bock, the former U.S. Anti-Doping Agency counsel, in a piece he published literally hours before the decision that predicted — just as I did — that Valieva not only would but should be allowed to skate, literally and figuratively: “… the for-public-consumption position of the sport executives is that a 15-year-old athlete should be perp-walked out of the Olympics because the adults did not handle her case in a timely fashion.”\n\nThat’s what we want?\n\nThat’s what Sarah Hirshland, the chief executive of the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee, wants?\n\nApparently so.\n\nThis, in a Twitter post, is what she had to say in response to the CAS decision, and the opinion here is that it’s appalling:\n\n“We are disappointed by the message this decision sends. It is the collective responsibility of the entire Olympic community to protect the integrity of sport and to hold our athletes, coaches and all involved to the highest of standards. Athletes have the right to know they are competing on a level playing field. Unfortunately, today that right is being denied. This appears to be another chapter in the systemic and pervasive disregard for clean sport by Russia.\n\n“We know this case is not yet closed, and we call on everyone in the Olympic Movement to continue to fight for clean sport on behalf of athletes around the world.”\n\nThis is unbelievable, really. Hirshland has no facts, zero, to assert with any credibility that this appears to be another chapter in the Sochi 2014-linked Russian saga. If there are those facts, she has a moral and legal obligation to bring such evidence forward. Otherwise, what? It’s rhetoric. Empty rhetoric.\n\nIf Hirshland really wanted to show the world the highest of standards, the best that America stands for, she could have offered this, what the vice-president and I learned in law school in San Francisco:\n\nIn systems, the authorities typically wield tremendous power. Mechanisms can be devised to afford an accused certain protections. Since 1776, when we declared that we were all equal, and all the more so since 1791 and the ratification of the Bill of Rights, the United States of America has been the world leader in not just affirming but giving voice to the rights of the individual, particularly our 4th, 5th and 6th Amendment rights. Those rights have taken on deeper and richer meaning since the enactment of the 14th Amendment, after the Civil War, and even more profound meaning since the 1960s, since Gideon, Miranda, Katz and other cases all but revolutionized criminal procedure. Are we flawed as a society? Surely. Can we do better? Certainly. But we mean it, dammit, we mean it, when we say you are innocent until proven otherwise. And the authorities have to prove otherwise.\n\nEspecially when you are, you know, 15.\n\nAt 15, in the United States, you would be maybe, probably in ninth grade.\n\nYou know what’s a really typical book to read in freshman English all across the United States? The Catcher in the Rye, J.D. Salinger’s 1951 masterpiece. How appropriate for these Olympics. What are the two main themes of that book?\n\nIsolation.\n\nAnd protecting the innocent.\n\nBack to Hirshland, and the “unfortunately” — what’s most here is precisely the narrative she and USOPC board chair Susanne Lyone have helped amplify, one that has driven much of the mainstream media, particularly the American press, over the past several days in its reporting over the Valieva matter.\n\nWe will all do well when this matter is over to engage in some serious study and reflection because pack journalism is a deadly menace to democracy.\n\nYou don’t have to go to law school to know that the First Amendment charges us in the American press to hold people accountable — to try to get to the truth.\n\nNowhere in its Feb. 11 Page One story on Valieva do the words “protected person” appear in The New York Times — though the fact that she is 15 is the key to unwinding the case. Instead, the Times reprises in the third paragraph, what journalists call the nut graf, the essence of the story, the “state-sponsored doping scheme” that has been an eight-year saga.\n\nIn all, 27 paragraphs. The focus: “an embarrassing failure” of systems. What about the 15-year-old at the center of it? What about her? Her humanity?\n\nIn the 13th and final paragraph of what in journalism is called a “sidebar,” a story that accompanies the main story, the Times gets around to noting Valieva’s status as a “protected person.” That story did not run on the front page of the printed editions. It ran on page 6 of the D section — for all intents and purposes, buried.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal’s Feb. 10 article? Nothing about Valieva’s “protected person” status. But two full paragraphs about the case potentially presenting “a potentially explosive controversy because it involves Russia.”\n\nUSA Today’s anti-Russia coverage has been so brutally over the top it’s — it’s just over the top, that’s all.\n\nWhat’s in these East Coast-based print outlets typically serves as feed for broadcasters, including CNN, NPR and more. The circle completes itself because typically no one feels they’re getting beat on the story. But this doesn’t necessarily create journalism of service. This creates a narrative.\n\nThere have been exceptions. The Washington Post, in its Feb. 11 story, noted that Valieva was a “protected person.” Of course, the ITA had made it easy — it said so in the very first sentence [emphasis mine] of the statement it had issued that very day. Which, of course, was available to the Post, Times and everyone.\n\nSo why the harsh and unyielding spotlight on Russia, Russia, Russia?\n\nPredictably, what that sort of focus leads to is what we got Monday in the Journal, in the aftermath of the CAS announcement — furious backtracking, the journalistic equivalent of the Flintstones, the second paragraph saying that the ruling “came as a surprise,” the third graf offering that the panel “appears to have relied on a novel provision in the anti-doping code that created room to arrive at a solution other than an automatic suspension for ‘protected persons,’ specifically athletes under the age of 16.”\n\nNovel provision? It’s February 2022. It was new for the 2021 version. Which took effect 13 months ago.\n\nThe Russia-is-bad narrative is, to be honest, evocative of the movie Rocky IV, and Ivan Drago is not gonna pop out here any moment to get whacked by Rocky Balboa. That movie was made in 1985. The Soviet Union fell in 1991. Enough already.\n\nThe president of the IOC, Thomas Bach, has made it abundantly clear, time and again, why the Russians are at the Games, Summer and Winter. By now, no one is questioning a state-associated doping story. That’s established. It’s also completely, thoroughly irrelevant — at least to the matter of why the Russians are in Beijing and were in Tokyo last summer, too, as ‘ROC.’ If you don’t like it, get over it. As Bach said last week at the IOC general assembly, the point of an Olympics is to gather all of humanity together in all its diversity. All means everyone. Everyone includes Russians as ROC.\n\nMoreover, if more of us in the press were paying closer attention to what the IOC was saying the last couple of days instead of, again, beating the Russia-is-bad drum, the clues that Valieva was gonna be cleared to skate were all there.\n\nThe IOC almost always speaks in code. Even this week, when it purportedly was saying nothing about Valieva, it spoke loud and clear, if you were listening. That is, the IOC was not dropping any clues about Valieva herself. But its generalized observations were elsewhere.\n\nOn Saturday, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said at a news conference, “Entourage has been overlooked in the past. The IOC, as ever, would welcome investigation into the entourage in all cases where it’s relevant. In this case, as in all cases, we would welcome a strong line from WADA,” the World Anti-Doping Agency, “on that.\n\n“Entourage ranges from doctors and coaches, parents, everyone.”\n\nIndeed, as the New York Times wrote in the very last two paragraphs [again: emphasis mine] of its story Monday after the CAS announcement dropped, and this is the real fight in the Valieva case, not a skater who on ice has proved herself an artist but, let’s be clear, is still just 15:\n\n“Because she is only 15 she is recognized as a ‘protected person’ under anti-doping rules, so her case will meet different standards of evidence and she would face lesser penalties if any, than adults would. It is also possible that she could receive only a reprimand for using the banned drug or for having it in her system.\n\n“The people more likely to face punishment would be any of her coaches, trainers and medical personnel who might have known about her using the drug or who might have given it to her.”\n\nValieva is in the last group Tuesday scheduled to take to the ice. The call sheet says it’s her turn at 9:52 p.m.\n\nIt ought to make for compelling theater.

Why did you stop fighting?” Tutberidze asked a still reeling Valieva. “After the axel, you let it go.”\n\nTutberidze put her arm around her, but Valieva was visibly inconsolable.\n\nTutberidze’s coaching methods were already in the spotlight after the Russian Anti-Doping Agency and the World Anti-Doping Agency said they would investigate Valieva’s entourage following the revelation that she had tested positive for a banned substance ahead of the Games.\n\nBut her reception of the young athlete Thursday has only added to mounting questions about Valieva’s team, and sparked a broader conversation about the suitability of minors competing in the Olympics and the rules that govern them.\n\nThe reaction of another distraught Russian skater, Alexandra Trusova, only added to the sorry picture.\n\n“I hate this sport,” she shouted at the side of the rink after winning silver in the same competition Thursday. “I won’t go onto the ice again.”\n\nTrusova later said her comments about not skating again had been “emotional,\" the result of missing her family and her dogs, but didn’t commit to compete at next month’s world championships.\n\n“All of this does not give me much confidence in this closest entourage of Kamila, neither with regard to what happened in the past nor as far as it concerns the future,” said Bach, without naming anyone.\n\nIt was not just the IOC who were critical of the Russian Olympic Committee and its coaches.\n\nNBC Olympics host Mike Tirico said Thursday that those surrounding Valieva had failed her.\n\n“Portrayed by some this week as the villain, by others as the victim, she is, in fact, the victim of the villains,” he said. “Whether they orchestrated, prescribed or enabled, all of this is unclear.

The delayed news of her positive test raised many questions, including whether it is time to add minimum age limits to Olympic participation.\n\nAge limits at the Olympics are set by each International Federations (IF) — the international sports bodies that govern individual sports — and not by the International Olympic Committee. Specifically, Rule 42 of the Olympic Charter states: “There may be no age limit for competitors in the Olympic Games other than as prescribed in the competition rules of an IF as approved by the IOC Executive Board.”\n\nJust like the IOC does for sex testing, eligibility rules for age are deferred to the IFs. Some IFs have decided that age matters, and imposed minimum age restrictions for Olympic participation — others have not. These range from 13 for fencing and 14 for taekwondo and bobsled, to 17 for wrestling, cycling and weightlifting, and 20 for the marathon.\n\nHow young is too young?\n\nMany people believe Valieva is too young to have doped without adult involvement. But there is no “too young” to commit a doping offense. For example, a 12-year-old Polish boy tested positive for nikethamide and received a two-year ban from the Federation Internationale de L'Automobile. His lawyer argued he should not be sanctioned because he was too young to compete at the Youth Olympic Games (YOG). Despite his age, and the banned substance being traced to an energy bar, the Court of Arbitration for Sport only reduced his ban by six months, noting he was not too young for the anti-doping rules to apply.\n\nAt the inaugural YOG, two 17-year-old wrestlers failed doping tests and were required to forfeit their participation certificates and any medals won. Both were suspended from the sport for two years, and their names were entered into the public doping registry of the IF (now known as United World Wresting), despite their legal status as minors.\n\n(AP Photo/Amy Sancetta, File)\n\nTwo more examples illustrate that age does not protect an athlete from the consequences of doping at the Olympics. At the 1972 Summer Games, 16-year-old swimmer Rick DeMont of the United States lost his gold medal in the 400-metre freestyle when he tested positive for ephedrine. All involved in the case understood that the ephedrine was part of his prescription asthma medication. His team physician failed to disclose the athlete’s required use of the medication, yet the disqualification stood.\n\nSixteen-year-old Romanian gymnast Andreea Răducan was in the same boat at the Sydney 2000 Olympics, when a cold tablet given to her by her team physician contained a banned substance. Jacques Rogge, who was appointed president of the IOC a year later, acknowledged to reporters the injustice of the situation: “This is one of the worst experiences I have had in my Olympic life.”\n\nThe Olympic movement has long held the position that doping rules are firm. What’s different now is the increased awareness of athlete mental health, the role of the entourage and the risks associated with overtraining and specialization at a young age. The range of reactions to Valieva’s saga, from Tara Lipinski’s outrage to Katarina Witt’s compassion, highlights the need to consider different models of youth participation.\n\nAge limits for athletes: yay or nay?\n\nBanning young athletes from the Olympics would mean we miss spectacular performances like Chinese diver Fu Mingxia’s gold in the 10-metre platform diving at the Barcelona 1992 Olympics at age 13, and Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci’s perfect 10 at the 1976 Montreal Olympics at age 14.\n\n(AP Photo/Suzanne Vlamis)\n\nBut considering all we know about overtraining, exploitation and abuse in sport, that might not be a bad thing.\n\nProtection-based age limits are unlikely to be effective. Youth who are ineligible to compete at the Olympics can still train the same number of hours as their older, eligible competitors.\n\nSolutions must recognize that child athletes are the most vulnerable population affected by doping and, legally, have not developed the capacity to make rational, independent decisions. As the history and philosophy of childhood literature establishes, the division between childhood and adulthood, and the time in between, is hard to categorize and is culturally conditioned.\n\nThe inclusion of a protected persons category in the 2021 update to the World Anti-Doping Code is a step forward.\n\nWADA now acknowledges protected persons as athletes who are under 16 years (or under 18 if the athlete is not part of a registered testing pool or has not competed at international events) or are otherwise not legally competent. The code states that mandatory public disclosure is not required when a protected person commits an anti-doping rule violation, but it does not go so far as to prohibit media reporting on the athlete. What this means in practice is unclear.\n\nMany questions remain about why Valieva was permitted to continue competing, and more debate about what we owe “protected people” is needed.", "authors": ["Sarah Teetzel"], "publish_date": "2022/02/18"}, {"url": "https://nypost.com/tag/figure-skating/", "title": "Figure Skating | New York Post"}, {"url": "https://sportsmax.tv/other-sports/item/100601-skaters-must-be-at-least-17-to-compete-in-senior-events-after-valieva-beijing-saga", "title": "Skaters must be at least 17 to compete in senior events after Valieva ..."}]}

And by the time Biden arrives to the summit Wednesday, questions over the event’s invitation list and attendees will have obscured its larger purpose, a source of frustration to administration officials who didn’t necessarily expect the mess.\n\nThe decision by several countries to stay away from the southern California gathering, a protest of Biden’s decision not to invite three regional autocrats, has underscored the struggle to exert US influence in a region that has become fractured politically and is struggling economically.\n\nAnd it has exposed the difficulties and contradictions in Biden’s vow to restore democratic values to American foreign policy. Even as he takes a stand against inviting dictators to a summit on US soil, prompting anger and boycotts from those key regional partners, his aides are simultaneously planning a visit to Saudi Arabia — seen as a necessity at a moment of a global energy crisis, despite the kingdom’s grave human rights record. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday the kingdom is an “important partner,” though Biden once said it must be made a “pariah.”\n\nIn the end, the White House announced Tuesday that 23 heads of state will attend this week’s Summit of the Americas, which administration officials said was in line with past iterations of the triennial confab. One leader who was on the fence, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, will attend and meet Biden for the first time.\n\nYet the absences of the presidents of Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are still notable since the United States has worked to cultivate those leaders as partners on immigration, an issue that looms as a political liability for Biden.\n\nAdministration officials on Monday dismissed concerns about attendance at the summit, saying they did not believe lower-level delegates from certain countries will alter the outcome.\n\n“We really do expect that the participation will not be in any way a barrier to getting significant business done at the summit. In fact, quite the opposite, we are very pleased with how the deliverables are shaping up and with other countries commitment to them,” one senior administration official said, adding the commitments will range from short term to long term.\n\nAnd the White House insisted the President was firm in his view that the autocratic leaders of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua should not be invited to participate — even if it means widening rifts with other countries in the region.\n\n“At the end of the day, to your question, we just don’t believe dictators should be invited. We don’t regret that, and the President will stand by his principle,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\nTroubles have been on the horizon for months\n\nBiden, who arrives in Los Angeles on Wednesday, is expected announce a new partnership with countries in the Western Hemisphere during the gathering as part of a broader effort to stabilize the region, according to the officials.\n\nHe and his administration have been working since last year to organize the summit, which was formally announced last August. The city of Los Angeles was selected as the venue in January. Biden named former Sen. Chris Dodd, his friend and former colleague on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as the special adviser for the event.\n\nDodd traveled in the region to muster support, one of a number of administration envoys to Central and South America that included Vice President Kamala Harris and even first lady Jill Biden. Yet as the summit approached, it became evident an event designed to reassert American leadership in the region was facing serious hurdles.\n\nFor weeks before the summit began, López Obrador hinted that he would boycott unless all leaders from the region were invited – including those from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, each of whom has faced US opposition because of their human rights records. Other, mostly leftist leaders signaled they, too, may not attend if invitations did not go to everyone.\n\nAdministration officials privately cast doubt those leaders would follow through on their threats, suggesting they were instead attempts to play to domestic audiences that are often skeptical of the United States.\n\nDuring an April telephone call between Biden and López Obrador, the subject of the summit arose. In a readout, the White House said the men “looked forward to meeting again at the June Summit of the Americas,” a sign the administration believed then the Mexican president would attend.\n\nOver the past weeks, Dodd spent lengthy virtual sessions lobbying López Obrador to reconsider his threat of a boycott. Members of Congress – including Sen. Bob Menendez, Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee – began to publicly agitate against inviting any leaders from Cuba, Venezuela or Nicaragua. And frustration mounted among administration officials that questions over the invitations and attendees were clouding out the summit’s intended goals.\n\n“The biggest problem is that the focus on attendance takes us away from the focus on substance, but that is the logical thing that happens ahead of a summit. It’s like the sausage-making period. We don’t talk much about the substance because the summit hasn’t started yet, we talk only about who might be there,” said Roberta Jacobson, the former US ambassador to Mexico who also served as an adviser to Biden on southern border policy.\n\nUltimately, the weeks of speculation were put to rest — but not in the way the White House had hoped.\n\n“There cannot be a Summit of the Americas if all countries of the Americas cannot attend,” López Obrador said at a news conference in Mexico City. “This is to continue the old interventionist policies, of lack of respect for nations and their people.”\n\nMexican President’s absence not a part of a larger rift, officials say\n\nMexican officials had conveyed their President’s decision to the White House beforehand, and Biden was made aware before the news became public. Instead of meeting at the summit, Biden and López Obrador will meet in Washington next month.\n\n“The fact that they disagree about this issue is now very clear,” a senior administration official said.\n\nOfficials sought to emphasize the decision to boycott was rooted in a specific disagreement over the invite list and was not indicative of a larger rift.\n\n“What we have done in recent weeks, going back almost a month now, is consulted – consulted with our partners and friends in the region so that we understood the contours of their views,” the senior administration official said. “In the end, the President decided and very much made this point in all of the engagements that we had … which is that we believe the best use of this summit is to bring together countries that share a set of democratic principles.”\n\nBiden is turning his focus to the Americas after a series of foreign policy crises in other parts of the world, including the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He completed his first visit to Asia at the end of last month.\n\nThat region is one where his animating message of “autocracy versus democracy” is playing out in real time, as China works to make inroads and economically challenged nations look for support from abroad.\n\nIn opening remarks Wednesday, Biden will unveil the so-called “Americas partnership” that will focus on five issues, including economic recovery, mobilizing investments, supply chains, clean energy and trade – all with the hopes of strengthening US partnerships in a region many US leaders have been accused of ignoring.\n\nDuring the summit, Biden is also expected to announce more than $300 million in assistance to fight food insecurity, in addition to other private sector commitments, as well as health initiatives and a partnership on climate resilience.\n\nBiden to unveil new initiatives at summit\n\nWhile at the summit, the President and his team will be unveiling a series of new initiatives.\n\nHarris, who arrived in Los Angeles earlier in the week, on Tuesday announced two updates to her work in addressing the root causes of migration to the southern border. First, she announced that through her “Call to Action,” which aimed to promoting economic opportunity, she has now secured more than $3.2 billion in private investment for the region.\n\nCNN previously reported the new commitments come from 10 companies totaling more than $1.9 billion, including the Gap Inc. which has pledged $150 million by 2025 to increase their sourcing from Central America, according to a fact sheet from the White House. Other companies include Millicom, Yazaki, Unifi, San Mar, Pantaleon and Fundación Terra.\n\nHarris also said she will be launching “In Her Hands,” a new private sector program aimed at empowering, training and protecting men in the northern Central America region and across the Western Hemisphere.\n\nAnd on Wednesday the Biden administration will unveil an “Action Plan on Health and Resilience in the Americas,” which is aimed at helping partner nations “prevent, prepare for, and respond to future pandemic threats and other public health emergencies while also expanding the equitable delivery of healthcare and public health services to remote, vulnerable, and marginalized populations,” a senior administration official said. The senior administration official said the plan is expected to be fully implemented by 2030.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra is expected to announce the initiative at the CEO Summit Plenary Session as well..\n\nAs part of Wednesday’s announcement, the administration is slated to announce roughly $100 million in funding, in concert with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), to provide basic and specialized training for 500,000 public health, health science and medical professionals through the next five years through the newly launched Americas Health Corps, or Fuerza de Salud de las Americas.\n\nCaravan highlights need to work fast on migration\n\nAs the summit was getting underway, the imperative to make progress on immigration was being starkly illustrated in southern Mexico. A new migrant caravan there set out on foot Monday, timed to bring attention to the issue as leaders were gathering in Los Angeles.\n\nAn official with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said a group of about 2,300 people left the southern Mexican city of Tapachula on Monday heading north. The official said the group is comprised mostly of Venezuelans, but also includes migrants from Nicaragua, Cuba, El Salvador and Honduras.\n\nA regional immigration group, Colectivo de Observación y Monitoreo de Derechos Humanos en el SE Mexicano, said in a bulletin that the group included principally families and children “who demand access to migration procedures and dignified treatment by the authorities.” Tapachula, located just across the border from Guatemala, is a popular way station for migrants traveling from Central America.\n\nUnder Mexican immigration laws, migrants and asylum-seekers are often made to wait in the area for several months with limited opportunities for work. Northward caravans of migrants have left Tapachula regularly in the past year, although this week’s appears to be one of the largest. This caravan gathered partially in protest to immigration policies and it would be weeks before they arrived to the US southern border, assuming they all do.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Biden and other leaders are expected to agree to a new migration document, dubbed the Los Angeles Declaration, during their Friday meetings. It’s meant to spell out how countries in the region and around the world should share responsibility for taking in migrants.\n\nOfficials said they were confident Mexico would sign on.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-to-host-immigration-americas-summit-november/", "title": "Biden to host first-of-its-kind Americas summit to address ..."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/06/world/americas/mexico-obrador-americas-summit.html", "title": "Mexico's President Obrador Will Not Attend Americas Summit - The ...", "text": "MEXICO CITY — In a rebuke to President Biden, the president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said Monday that he would not attend the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles after news emerged that the United States would not invite Cuban, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan leaders to the meeting.\n\nMr. López Obrador had threatened to boycott the summit for weeks unless all countries in the Americas were invited, but he made good on his promise during his morning news conference, announcing that Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard would attend in his stead.

As Biden runs for reelection in 2024, he is the ninth oldest national leader in the world, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of sitting leaders in 187 United Nations member states.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who is running for the White House again this year, is younger than Biden. But at 77, Trump also falls among the 20 oldest world leaders when compared with those currently in power.\n\nHow we did this With current U.S. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump both running for reelection to the country’s highest office, Pew Research Center examined the ages of current national leaders to place the ages of Biden and Trump into a global context. This analysis examines the ages of the current heads of government in 187 countries that are member states of the United Nations, relying on government biographies and regional news articles. It reflects the ages of national leaders – and in a few instances, acting or interim leaders – as of May 1, 2024. It excludes six UN member states for which an exact birth date of the leader could not be found: Afghanistan, Haiti, Iraq, Mali, Niger and Somalia. For each of these countries, we reached out to embassy officials in the United States but did not receive further information. This analysis focuses mostly on heads of government as defined by a country’s political system or constitution. In some cases, we determined the national leader based on which executive has the power to appoint/dismiss the nominal head of government. In San Marino, where there are two captains regent who share power, we included data for Alessandro Rossi, as he assumed the position most recently. This analysis also draws on Freedom House country rankings to determine whether countries are free, partly free or not free. These rankings are based on two numerical scores assigned to each country for its political rights and civil liberties. The median age of each country’s overall population is a 2024 projection from the UN’s World Population Prospects 2022 report. The projections are based on “all available sources of data on population size and levels of fertility, mortality and international migration.”\n\nAmerican voters are skeptical about both candidates’ fitness for the job, according to a recent Center survey. Only about four-in-ten U.S. registered voters are extremely or very confident that Trump has the mental fitness to be president (38%), while a similar share are confident in his physical fitness (36%). Even fewer express this degree of confidence in Biden’s mental (21%) and physical (15%) fitness for the role.\n\nBelow are five key facts about the ages of current national leaders.\n\nNational leaders range in age from their mid-30s to 91. The youngest leader is Burkina Faso’s Ibrahim Traoré, who is 36. He only slightly edges out two fellow 36-year-olds, Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa and Montenegrin Prime Minister Milojko Spajić. Only two other world leaders are in their 30s: Irish Taoiseach Simon Harris and Chilean President Gabriel Boric.\n\nThe oldest national leader is President Paul Biya of Cameroon, who was born in 1933 and took office more than 40 years ago. Biya is the only current national leader in his 90s.\n\nThe median age of current national leaders is 62, as of May 1, 2024. The largest share of global leaders today (34%) are in their 60s. Roughly a quarter (22%) are in their 50s; 19% are in their 70s; and 16% are in their 40s. Biden is among the 5% of leaders who are in their 80s.\n\nCountries that are less free tend to have older leaders. In countries that Freedom House classifies as “not free,” the median age of the national leader is 68. That compares with 62 in countries that are classified as “partly free” and 60 in countries classified as “free.”\n\nThe United States is one of only three countries that are classified as free and have a leader age 80 or older; the other two are Ghana and Namibia. In Ghana, President Nana Akufo-Addo recently turned 80 in office. And in Namibia, 82-year-old Nangolo Mbumba took over as president earlier this year following the previous leader’s death in office at age 82.\n\nThe median age for women leaders and men leaders is the same. Among men who are world leaders, 3% are in their 30s, while no women leaders are in this age group. Yet, of the 14 women leaders currently in power, 29% are in their 40s, compared with 14% of leaders who are men.\n\nPrime Minister Mette Frederiksen of Denmark is the youngest female leader at 46, followed closely by fellow 46-year-old Kaja Kallas, the prime minister of Estonia. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh is the oldest female leader at 76.\n\nIn most countries, the leader is significantly older than the median member of the population. For example, the median American is 38, according to UN population projections for 2024, while Biden is more than twice as old. In fact, the only countries that have a leader who is younger than the median resident of the country are Montenegro, Ireland and Italy. Andorran Prime Minister Xavier Espot Zamora, at 44, is the same age as the median Andorran resident.\n\nIn general, countries that Freedom House classifies as free are more likely than those classified as partly free or not free to have leaders who are closer in age to the median resident of the country.\n\nNote: This is an update of a post originally published on March 24, 2023.", "authors": ["Laura Silver", ".Wp-Block-Prc-Block-Bylines-Display Background Inherit Box-Sizing Inherit Color Inherit Color Var --Wp--Preset--Color--Text-Color", "Font-Family Var --Wp--Preset--Font-Family--Sans-Serif", "Font-Size Font-Weight Gap Important Line-Height", "Margin-Bottom Text-Transform Uppercase .Wp-Block-Prc-Block-Bylines-Display A Text-Decoration None Important .Wp-Block-Prc-Block-Bylines-Display A Hover Text-Decoration Underline Important .Wp-Block-Prc-Block-Bylines-Display .Prc-Platform-Staff-Bylines__Separator Margin-Left", ".Wp-Block-Prc-Block-Bylines-Query Background Inherit Color Inherit"], "publish_date": "2024/05/01"}, {"url": "https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2023/11/03/biden-hosts-leaders-from-countries-across-the-americas-at-the-wh", "title": "Biden hosts leaders from countries across the Americas", "text": "Hosting nearly a dozen leaders from nations across the Western Hemisphere at the White House on Friday, President Joe Biden announced new efforts to bolster economic collaboration in the region – with countering China’s influence and addressing migration issues that have been a thorn in his side since he took office top of mind.\n\nWhat You Need To Know President Joe Biden announced new efforts to bolster economic collaboration in the region at a summit with nearly a dozen leaders from nations across the Western Hemisphere Countering China’s influence and addressing migration issues that have been a thorn in Biden's side since he took office were top of mind All of the promises to bolster cooperation and spur more resilient economies come with the hope it will help tackle migration issues plaguing the hemisphere\n\nFriday’s inaugural summit – titled the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity Leader’s Summit – was born out of an agreement made at last year’s Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles.\n\n“One key outcome of the summit was this partnership and 12 countries committing to drive innovative approaches to shared challenges, to grow our economies from the bottom up and the middle out,” Biden told fellow Western Hemisphere leaders on Friday, invoking the same message he uses to describe his economic agenda at home.\n\nThe U.S. president was joined by the leaders of Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Barbados, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay in the East Room of the White House for Friday’s meeting. Mexico sent its foreign minister in place of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to participate. Panama also sent its top diplomat.\n\nBiden told his fellow leaders the mission was to make “the Western Hemisphere the most economically competitive region in the world.”\n\n“I think that’s totally within our reach,” he added.\n\nTo that end, Biden used the summit to announce efforts to strengthen investment in the region through the US International Development Finance Corporation and the Inter-American Development Bank. The president pledged the creation of a new platform to “channel billions of dollars toward building sustainable infrastructure in the hemisphere and strengthening critical supply chains.”\n\n“Modern ports, clean energy grids, digital infrastructure – these are the building blocks, the building blocks, for a competitive and resilient economy,” he declared.\n\nThe move builds on the United States’ efforts to bolster its relationships with Latin American nations as China’s influence in the region grows and the economic competition between the U.S. and China – the world’s two largest economies – heats up.\n\n“We want to make sure that our closest neighbors know they have a real choice between debt-trap diplomacy and high quality, transparent approaches to infrastructure and to development,” Biden said, just after making sure to emphasize that the U.S. is “already the largest source of investment across Latin America and the Caribbean by far.”\n\nAlso among Friday’s announcements was the launch of a program to aid entrepreneurs in the region “develop and fund their ideas.”\n\nAll of the promises to bolster cooperation and spur more resilient economies come with the hope it will help tackle migration issues plaguing the hemisphere.\n\nBiden mentioned the declaration on migration signed at last year’s Summit of the Americas, in which nearly 20 nations in the region agreed to work on boosting aid to countries hosting large numbers of migrants, seek ways to expand legal pathways and promote humane border management.\n\n“I've asked the United States Congress for supplemental funds to carry out this three-part strategy in our country and I urge them to act quickly,” Biden said, referring to his more than $100 billion request for aid to Israel amid its war with Hamas, Ukraine as it fends off Russia’s invasion, the Indo-Pacific and U.S.-Mexico border security.\n\nThe bill faces headwinds in Congress where the House, in response to Biden’s request, just passed a bill that included only the aid for Israel and left out Ukraine, the Indo-Pacific and the border. The bill – which offsets the cost by taking money allocated for the Internal Revenue Service – is unlikely to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate and the White House has already said it would veto it.\n\nDemocrats want to pass Israel, Ukraine, Indo-Pacific and border funding in one bill.\n\nNew House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he will later bring a second bill to the floor that combines Ukraine aid and border security funding. Republicans have made Biden’s handling of the U.S.-Mexico border one of their key criticisms of the Democratic president’s administration as the U.S. wrestles with record numbers of migrants illegally crossing into the country.\n\n“In each of our countries, our people are young, dynamic, diverse, poised to seize the future. I think they really are,” Biden said to conclude his remarks on Friday. “All we need to do is keep going, keep delivering on the positive vision we all share for a region that is secure, prosperous and democratic.”", "authors": ["Published Pm Et Nov."], "publish_date": "2023/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/06/10/americas-image-abroad-rebounds-with-transition-from-trump-to-biden/", "title": "America's Image Abroad Rebounds With Transition From Trump to ...", "text": "But many raise concerns about health of U.S. political system\n\nThe election of Joe Biden as president has led to a dramatic shift in America’s international image. Throughout Donald Trump’s presidency, publics around the world held the United States in low regard, with most opposed to his foreign policies. This was especially true among key American allies and partners. Now, a new Pew Research Center survey of 16 publics finds a significant uptick in ratings for the U.S., with strong support for Biden and several of his major policy initiatives.\n\nHow we did this This analysis focuses on public opinion of the United States in 16 advanced economies in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Views of the U.S. and its president are examined in the context of long-term trend data. The report also explores how people view President Joe Biden’s proposed policies and characteristics. For this report, we use data from nationally representative surveys of 16,254 adults from March 12 to May 26, 2021. All surveys were conducted over the phone with adults in Canada, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the UK, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. This study was conducted in places where nationally representative telephone surveys are feasible. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, face-to-face interviewing is not currently possible in many parts of the world. Here are the questions used for the report, along with responses, and the survey methodology.\n\nIn each of the 16 publics surveyed, more than six-in-ten say they have confidence in Biden to do the right thing in world affairs. Looking at 12 nations surveyed both this year and in 2020, a median of 75% express confidence in Biden, compared with 17% for Trump last year.\n\nDuring the past two decades, presidential transitions have had a major impact on overall attitudes toward the U.S. When Barack Obama took office in 2009, ratings improved in many nations compared with where they had been during George W. Bush’s administration, and when Trump entered the White House in 2017, ratings declined sharply. This year, U.S. favorability is up again: Whereas a median of just 34% across 12 nations had a favorable overall opinion of the U.S. last year, a median of 62% now hold this view.\n\nIn France, for example, just 31% expressed a positive opinion of the U.S. last year, matching the poor ratings from March 2003, at the height of U.S.-France tensions over the Iraq War. This year, 65% see the U.S. positively, approaching the high ratings that characterized the Obama era. Improvements of 25 percentage points or more are also found in Germany, Japan, Italy, the Netherlands and Canada.\n\nStill, attitudes toward the U.S. vary considerably across the publics surveyed. For instance, only about half in Singapore and Australia have a favorable opinion of the U.S., and just 42% of New Zealanders hold this view. And while 61% see the U.S. favorably in Taiwan, this is actually down slightly from 68% in a 2019 poll.\n\nIn most countries polled, people make a stark distinction between Biden and Trump as world leaders. Nearly eight-in-ten Germans (78%) have confidence in Biden to do the right thing in world affairs; a year ago, just 10% said this about Trump. Similar differences are found in Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands, and in all nations where a trend is available from 2020 there is a difference of at least 40 percentage points.\n\nAs is the case with views of the United States as a whole, confidence in U.S. presidents has shifted dramatically over the past two decades, especially in Western Europe. In Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain and France – four nations Pew Research Center has surveyed consistently – ratings for Bush and Trump were similarly low during their presidencies, while this year confidence in Biden is fairly similar to the ratings Obama received while in office.\n\nBiden’s high ratings are tied in part to positive assessments of his personal characteristics, and here again the contrast with Trump is stark. Looking at 12 countries polled during the first year of both their presidencies, a median of 77% describe Biden as well-qualified to be president, compared with 16% who felt this way about Trump. Few think of Biden as arrogant or dangerous, while large majorities applied those terms to Trump. Assessments of the two leaders are more similar when it comes to being a strong leader, although even on this measure, Biden gets much more positive reviews than his predecessor.\n\nHigh levels of confidence in Biden are also tied to favorable views of his policies, several of which have emphasized multilateralism and reversed Trump administration decisions. The current survey examines attitudes toward four of the Biden administration’s key policies and finds widespread support for all four.\n\nA median of 89% across the 16 publics surveyed approve of the U.S. rejoining the World Health Organization (WHO), which the U.S. withdrew from during Trump’s presidency. A median of 85% also support the U.S. rejoining the Paris climate agreement. Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris agreement was met with widespread criticism, and it was overwhelmingly unpopular in the surveys the Center conducted during his presidency. For example, in 2019 just 8% in France approved of Trump’s plans to withdraw support for international climate change agreements, compared with 91% who now back Biden’s reentry into the agreement.\n\nSupport for the Biden administration’s proposal to organize a summit of democracies from around the world is also widespread, with a median of 85% saying they approve. There is only slightly less support (a median of 76%) for Biden’s plan to allow more refugees into the U.S. (Biden campaigned on allowing more refugees into the country, briefly reversed his initial goal to raise the refugee cap from levels set by the Trump administration, and then walked back the reversal amid criticism.)\n\nBiden has also made clear that he plans to strengthen America’s commitment to the NATO alliance. As the current poll shows, NATO is viewed positively by the member states included in the survey. (See “NATO continues to be seen in a favorable light by people in member states” for more.)\n\nAlthough Biden’s more multilateral approach to foreign policy is welcomed, there is still a widespread perception that the U.S. mainly looks after its own interests in world affairs. More than half in most of the publics surveyed say the U.S. does not take their interests into account when it is making foreign policy decisions, although fewer feel this way in Japan, Greece and Germany.\n\nDoubts about the U.S. considering the interests of other countries predate the Trump administration, and this has been the prevailing view – even among close U.S. allies – since the Center began asking the question in 2002.\n\nDespite widely reported bilateral and multilateral tensions between the U.S. and many of its major allies and partners over the last four years, relatively few people describe the U.S. as an “unreliable partner.” But neither do they express great confidence in the U.S. as an ally. Across the 16 publics polled, a median of 56% say the U.S. is somewhat reliable, while just 11% describe America as very reliable.\n\nIn addition to the concerns some have about how America engages with other nations, there are also concerns about domestic politics in the U.S. The 16 publics surveyed are divided in their views about how well the U.S. political system is functioning, with a median of only 5o% saying it is working well.\n\nAnd few believe American democracy, at least in its current state, serves as a good model for other nations. A median of just 17% say democracy in the U.S. is a good example for others to follow, while 57% say it used to be a good example but has not been in recent years. Another 23% do not believe it has ever been a good example.\n\nOne of the reasons for the low ratings the U.S. received in 2020 was the widespread perception that it was handling the global pandemic poorly. In the current poll, the U.S. gets significantly more positive marks for how it is handling COVID-19, but most still say the U.S. has done a bad job of dealing with the outbreak (for more, see “Global views of how U.S. has handled pandemic have improved, but few say it’s done a good job”).\n\nIn his first overseas trip as president, Biden is preparing to attend the G7 summit in the UK and the NATO summit in Brussels. Once there, he will meet with two other leaders widely trusted for their handling of world affairs.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel actually receives slightly higher ratings than Biden: A median of 77% across the 16 publics surveyed express confidence in Merkel’s international leadership. A smaller median of 63% voice confidence in French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nRelatively few trust Russian President Vladimir Putin to do the right thing in world affairs, while Chinese President Xi Jinping has the lowest ratings on the survey.\n\nThese are among the major findings from a Pew Research Center survey conducted among 16,254 respondents in 16 publics – not including the U.S. – from March 12 to May 26, 2021. The survey also finds that views toward the U.S. and President Biden often differ by ideology and age.\n\nSpotlight: How views of the U.S. vary with political ideology and age\n\nIdeology\n\nIn many of the publics surveyed, ideological orientation plays a role in how people view the U.S. and American democracy.\n\nPeople who place themselves on the right of the political spectrum are more likely to have a positive view of the U.S. in nearly every country where ideology is measured. And this general pattern has not changed much over time, with those on the right holding a more favorable view of the U.S. during the Trump and Obama administrations as well.\n\nIn 11 countries, people on the right are more likely than those on the left to say democracy in the U.S. is a good example for other countries to follow. And in a similar set of countries, they are also more likely to think the U.S. political system works well.\n\nOverall, majorities on the left, center and right of the political spectrum approve of the policies included in the survey. However, Biden’s decision to allow more refugees into the U.S. is decidedly more popular among people on the left. In about half the countries, those on the left are also more likely to approve of the U.S. rejoining the World Health Organization.\n\nAge\n\nIn general, favorable views of the U.S. do not vary based on age in Europe or the Asia-Pacific region. But age is a factor when it comes to confidence in the U.S. president and other world leaders.\n\nAcross most places surveyed, adults ages 65 and older are significantly more likely than those ages 18 to 29 to have confidence in Biden to do the right things in world affairs. Trust in Biden is so high overall, however, that at least half in all age groups hold this view.\n\nOlder adults also have more confidence in Merkel in half of the surveyed areas. Trust in Putin shows the opposite pattern, with younger adults more likely to have confidence in the Russian president in most of the publics surveyed.\n\nAdults under 30 also deviate from older adults in their views of American democracy. In about half of the publics surveyed, younger adults are more likely to think democracy in the U.S. has never been a good model for other countries to follow.\n\nFavorable views of the U.S. have rebounded\n\nIn every place surveyed except New Zealand, around half or more have a favorable opinion of the U.S. Ratings are highest in South Korea, where 77% have positive views of the U.S., and around two-thirds or more in Japan, France and the UK say the same.\n\nThese broadly positive views reflect a sharp uptick since last summer, when ratings of the U.S. were at or near historic lows in most countries. For example, in Belgium, where only a quarter had favorable views of the U.S. last year, a 56% majority say the same today.\n\nIn France, the UK and Germany, positive views have increased even since this past November and December. Surveys in these three countries found tepid views of the U.S. last December – after major media outlets had called the election for now-President Joe Biden but before his inauguration and the violent storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 by a mob of Trump’s supporters. Evaluations ranged from 40% favorable in Germany to 51% in the UK. Today, positive views have increased by double digits in all three countries, with around six-in-ten or more in each of these countries now saying they view the U.S. favorably.\n\nIn many places, favorable views of the U.S. have now rebounded to roughly the same levels that were seen toward the end of President Obama’s second term. Take France as an example: The share who have positive views of the U.S. has more than doubled since last year, from 31% – a record low – to 65%, which is comparable to the 63% who had favorable views of the U.S. at the end of the Obama administration.\n\nViews of American democracy and foreign policy both factor into how people feel about the U.S. For example, those who think the U.S. political system is working well and those who think American democracy is a good example for other countries to follow are much more likely to have favorable views of the U.S. Similarly, those who think the U.S. is a reliable partner and who think the U.S. takes other countries’ interests into account also have more positive views of the superpower. And people who believe the U.S. is doing a good job of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic are more likely to express a positive view of the country.\n\nSome concerns about functioning of U.S. democracy\n\nMajorities in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Sweden and the Netherlands are skeptical of how the U.S. political system functions. On the flip side, majorities in South Korea, Greece, Italy, Japan, Taiwan and Spain express at least some confidence in the American system of government.\n\nHowever, even among publics where majorities think the U.S. political system works at least somewhat well, this confidence is lukewarm: At most, about a fifth say the American political system functions very well. In most places surveyed, the share who say this is smaller than one-in-ten.\n\nWhile attitudes are mixed about how well the U.S. political system functions, publics in the advanced economies surveyed are largely skeptical that democracy in the U.S. is a good example for other countries to follow. Across all publics surveyed, no more than about three-in-ten say the U.S. is currently setting a good example of democratic values.\n\nRather, majorities or pluralities say American democracy used to be a good example but has not been in recent years, and up to about a quarter reject the idea that the U.S. has ever been a good model of democracy.\n\nOnly about a third say the U.S. considers their interests in foreign policy\n\nDespite the sharp uptick in favorable views of the U.S. and its president in 2021, most people surveyed continue to say the U.S. doesn’t take into account the interests of publics like theirs when making international policy decisions. Across the 16 publics, a median of 67% say the U.S. does not take their interests into account too much or at all, while only 34% say Washington considers their interests a great deal or fair amount.\n\nAcross the European countries surveyed, there is a fair amount of variation in this assessment. As few as 16% in Sweden say the U.S. considers Sweden’s interests when making foreign policy, but roughly half or more in Greece and Germany do. In Germany, this represents a 32 percentage point increase since 2018, when this question was last asked. Despite this uptick, replicated across many of the European nations surveyed in both years, majorities in the region say the U.S. does not consider their interests when making foreign policy decisions.\n\nAsian-Pacific publics also tend to say Washington discounts their interests, including 85% among New Zealanders. Around seven-in-ten in Australia and South Korea, as well as 54% in Singapore, concur that the U.S. does not consider their interests when making foreign policy.\n\nIn Taiwan, which has a complicated unofficial relationship with the U.S., 51% say the U.S. does not consider their interests, while 44% say it does. Among Japanese adults, opinions are almost equally divided between people who say the U.S. takes their views into account when making foreign policy and those that say the U.S. does not. (During the survey fielding, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga visited the U.S., attending what was Biden’s first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader since he became president.)\n\nThere have been significant increases in the shares saying the U.S. considers their interests when making foreign policy since the question was last asked during the Trump presidency. In addition to the jump in Germany, there have been double-digit increases in such sentiment in Greece, the Netherlands, Japan, Canada, France, the UK and Spain. In Greece and Canada, this is the highest such reading in a Pew Research Center survey, even compared with the Obama era.\n\nStill, the predominant sentiment, going back to 2002 when the question was first asked, is that the U.S. does not consider the interests of countries like theirs. The election of Joe Biden has not fundamentally changed that.\n\nMost say that the U.S. is a somewhat reliable partner\n\nAcross the 16 publics surveyed, majorities or pluralities say the U.S. is a somewhat reliable partner. But in no public surveyed do more than two-in-ten say that the U.S. is a very reliable partner.\n\nAt the same time, fewer than four-in ten say the U.S. is a not too reliable partner, and in no public do more than one-in-seven say that the U.S. is a not at all reliable partner.\n\nThe sentiment that the U.S. is a very or somewhat reliable partner is highest in the Netherlands (80%), Australia (75%) and Japan (75%). But 44% in Taiwan and 43% in Greece say the U.S. is not too or not at all reliable.\n\nNearly all say relations with U.S. will stay the same or get better over the next few years\n\nWhen asked whether relations with the U.S. will get better, worse or stay the same over the next few years, a median of 57% across the 16 publics say they will stay the same. While a continuation of current relations with the U.S. is the most common response, a median of 39% say relations will get better and only 5% say they will get worse.\n\nThe only place where a majority thinks relations with the U.S. will get better is Germany (60% say this), where attitudes about the transatlantic alliance have become increasingly pessimistic in recent years. Half of Canadians also say relations with their southern neighbor will get better over the next few years.\n\nIn 2017, when this question was asked specifically about then-newly elected President Trump and his effect on bilateral relations, the most common answer was also that they would remain the same. But back then, few said that relations with the U.S. would improve under Trump, and significant portions of the population thought they would deteriorate, including 56% in Germany who said this.\n\nHigh confidence in Biden across Europe, Asia-Pacific\n\nIn the first year of his presidency, Biden enjoys positive ratings from majorities in each of the publics surveyed. Overall, a median of 74% have confidence in the U.S. president to do the right thing in world affairs.\n\nConfidence is particularly high in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Germany and Canada, where about eight-in-ten or more trust Biden when it comes to international affairs. He receives his lowest ratings in Greece, South Korea and Taiwan, though more than six-in-ten in each trust his handling of world affairs.\n\nWidespread confidence in Biden contrasts starkly with views of his predecessor. Trust in the U.S. president was historically low in most countries surveyed during Trump’s presidency. In many cases, however, the share who have confidence in Biden is not as high as the share who had confidence in Obama at the start or end of his presidency.\n\nGermany is a good example of this pattern. In 2020, only 10% of Germans had confidence in Trump to do the right thing in world affairs (matching a previous all-time low earlier in Trump’s presidency). Once Biden took office, confidence in the U.S. president increased by 68 percentage points in Germany, but it is still lower there than the all-time high of 93% in 2009, Obama’s first year in office. A similar trend can be seen in Sweden, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Canada, Australia, South Korea and Japan.\n\nHowever, in Greece, confidence in the U.S. president is the highest it has been since Pew Research Center first asked this question there. A much higher share of Greeks have confidence in Biden compared with Obama in 2016 and earlier. Notably, Biden has shared a positive relationship with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, and Greeks are more than twice as likely now to say the U.S. takes their country’s interests into account when making policy decisions (53%) than they were when Obama was president (20% in 2013).\n\nBiden more trusted than Putin and Xi, less trusted than Merkel\n\nPublics express much more confidence in Biden than in Russian President Vladimir Putin or Chinese President Xi Jinping. Biden also fares well in comparison with French President Emmanuel Macron, but his ratings tend to trail those of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nA median of 77% have confidence in Merkel to do the right thing in world affairs. She receives somewhat higher ratings in the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Belgium, France, New Zealand and Australia than in her home country, though a large majority of Germans still express confidence in the chancellor. Of the 16 publics surveyed, Greece is the only one where fewer than half hold this view. Faith in Merkel has also increased since the summer of 2020 in six of the 12 countries where data is available for both years.\n\nA median of 63% have confidence in Macron when it comes to his handling of world affairs. Roughly eight-in-ten or more hold this view in Greece and Sweden. As with Merkel, Macron’s ratings in his home country are positive, but more subdued than in other publics; 53% of people in France trust the French president to do what is right in international affairs.\n\nMedians of only around one-in-five express confidence in Putin or Xi. Singapore and Greece are the only countries where more than half trust either president; 55% in both Greece and Singapore say they have confidence in Putin, and 70% in Singapore say the same of Xi.\n\nRatings for the Chinese president have been consistently low in many countries, particularly across the Western European nations surveyed, since this question was first asked in 2014. Opinion of Putin in these countries extends back even further and shows a similarly negative pattern there.\n\nBiden seen as well-qualified to be president\n\nReflecting high levels of confidence in the U.S. president, overwhelming majorities say Biden is well-qualified for the position, and many see him as a strong leader. Very few view Biden as either dangerous or arrogant. And in most cases, these views are in stark contrast to views of his predecessor.\n\nA median of 77% think Biden is well-qualified for his role as president, ranging from 64% in Japan to 84% in Sweden. Among many of these same publics polled in 2017, only a third or fewer saw Trump as well-qualified.\n\nThe gap between perceptions of the two American presidents is especially wide in Sweden and Germany. Only 10% of Swedes thought Trump was well-qualified to be president during his first year in office. In the current survey, 84% see Biden as qualified, a 74 percentage point difference. Among Germans, 6% thought Trump was well-qualified, compared with eight-in-ten who say the same of Biden this year.\n\nA difference of roughly 50 points or more on this question appears in nearly every country where data is available for both leaders.\n\nBiden and Trump are viewed the most similarly when it comes to perceptions of them as strong leaders. In 2017, relatively large shares saw Trump as a strong leader, even in countries where few had confidence in him to do the right thing in world affairs. In countries where data is available for both leaders, more people tend to see Biden as a strong leader, but in several countries, the difference is comparatively small.\n\nVery few people across the publics surveyed think Biden could be described as dangerous (median of 14%) or arrogant (median of 13%). This is a striking difference from how Trump was viewed early in his presidency.\n\nFor example, there is an 83-point difference in the Netherlands between those who viewed Trump as arrogant (92%) and those who currently say the same about Biden (9%). Differences of roughly 80 points or more on this question can also be seen in France, Sweden, Spain, Germany and Canada.\n\nSimilarly, majorities in each country saw Trump as dangerous in 2017, while no more than 21% hold this view of Biden, resulting in differences of roughly 40 points or more in countries where data is available for both leaders.\n\nBiden’s foreign policy agenda broadly popular across advanced economies\n\nThe Biden administration’s foreign policies included on the survey enjoy widespread popularity. Of the four policies tested, the United States’ reentry into the World Health Organization (WHO) garners the most approval, with a median of 89% saying they support the move. Support for this policy is most prevalent in Europe, where shares ranging from 86% to 94% approve of the U.S. returning to the organization. The move is also broadly popular in Canada and the Asia-Pacific.\n\nBiden’s decision to recommit to the Paris climate agreement is also very well received. A median of 85% approve of the U.S. rejoining the accord. Across Europe, about nine-in-ten or more across six countries polled favor the move, with respondents in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK following closely behind. Shares of roughly eight-in-ten or greater are also supportive in Canada and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nRejoining the accord represents a reversal from former President Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the agreement, a move that was met with widespread disapproval when Pew Research Center asked about it in 2017.\n\nIn all countries the Center surveyed both this year and four years ago, Biden’s approach is considerably more popular than Trump’s. For instance, in Spain, only 8% approved of Trump withdrawing support for international climate agreements in 2017, while 93% approve of the U.S. rejoining the Paris agreement this year, an 85 percentage point difference. In every country, rejoining the agreement is met with approval from shares at least four times as large as the shares who supported leaving it.\n\nIn addition to Biden’s reversal of Trump-era withdrawals from international organizations and pacts, his plans for the U.S. to host a summit of democratic nations earns widespread approval. Across the 16 publics polled, a median of 85% express support for the convening, and in each, eight-in-ten or more say they favor the plan.\n\nAttitudes toward this policy among several publics are divided by views of American democracy. Among most publics surveyed, those who think the U.S. is a good example of democracy for other countries to follow support the summit more than those who think the U.S. has never been a good example. For instance, in Sweden, 91% of those who think the U.S. is currently setting a good example of democratic values approve of the U.S. convening leaders from other democracies, compared with 71% of those who doubt the U.S. has ever set a good example of democracy, a 20-point difference.\n\nThose who view the U.S. as a reliable partner are more likely to approve of the U.S. hosting a summit of democratic nations in 13 of the publics surveyed. For example, in Germany, 89% of those who think the U.S. is a reliable partner approve of this policy, whereas only 68% of those who view the U.S. as unreliable agree, a 21-point difference.\n\nApproval of Biden’s plan to increase the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. is also widespread. A median of about three-quarters support the change, and nowhere do fewer than six-in-ten agree with the decision. This comes as Biden reversed his initial goal to raise the refugee cap in the U.S. from the levels set by the Trump administration, but then walked back the reversal amid criticism.", "authors": ["Richard Wike", "Jacob Poushter", "Laura Silver", "Janell Fetterolf", "Mara Mordecai", ".Wp-Block-Prc-Block-Bylines-Display Background Inherit Box-Sizing Inherit Color Inherit Color Var --Wp--Preset--Color--Text-Color", "Font-Family Var --Wp--Preset--Font-Family--Sans-Serif", "Font-Size Font-Weight Gap Important Line-Height", "Margin-Bottom Text-Transform Uppercase .Wp-Block-Prc-Block-Bylines-Display A Text-Decoration None Important .Wp-Block-Prc-Block-Bylines-Display A Hover Text-Decoration Underline Important .Wp-Block-Prc-Block-Bylines-Display .Prc-Platform-Staff-Bylines__Separator Margin-Left"], "publish_date": "2021/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.c-span.org/video/?536915-1/president-biden-attends-meeting-union-leaders-afl-cio", "title": "President Biden Attends Meeting With Union Leaders at AFL-CIO | C ..."}, {"url": "https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-is-mexicos-president-snubbing-bidens-invitation-to-the-summit-of-the-americas/", "title": "Why is Mexico's president snubbing Biden's invitation to the Summit ..."}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-excludes-cuba-venezuela-nicaragua-americas-summit-sources-2022-06-06/", "title": "U.S. bars Cuba, Venezuela from Americas summit; Mexican leader ..."}]}

It easily trounced its biggest competition, Top Gun: Maverick, which pulled in $52.7 million over the weekend. Dominion is now the №1 movie in the world.\n\nThe third installment in the Jurassic World series (and the 6th installment in the Jurassic Park franchise overall) managed to be a huge success despite receiving some pretty harsh reviews. In fact, though the film did receive an A- on CinemaScore, it remains the worst reviewed film in the franchise. While I agree with the CinemaScore grade, I have to say, it earned the less than flattering reviews.\n\nJurassic World: Dominion is a phenomenal film. It really is. It immediately separates itself from all of the other sequels to the original film, not only by being the only sequel to unite the original cast, but also by being the only sequel that attempts to offer some closure to all of the open themes and plots explored throughout the franchise. The problem Dominion runs into, isn’t that it’s not a good movie - it’s that it isn’t the movie some people were expecting to see.\n\nSince 2018’s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the expectation for the final film in the trilogy was delivering on the franchise’s title - a literal Jurassic world. At the end of Fallen Kingdom the idea was that the next film would depict humans and dinosaurs somewhat co-existing. Not necessarily like a morning walk to the mailbox that could result in dodging a raptor… but something like that. Dominion does not deliver on this.\n\nThis is illustrated in no better way than by the image I chose for this piece. In that image, the iconic T-Rex (presumably the original from Jurassic Park) is shown plowing through a drive-in movie theatre and roaring in-front of the movie screen, as people run for their lives. This scene comes from a 5 minute prologue (with over 5.5 million views) posted on the official Jurassic World YouTube account, 6 months ago. This sequence plays prominently in the GEICO ads that have been in heavy rotation ahead of Dominion’s release. The problem? That scene is not in the movie. None of the prologue footage, or the surrounding storyline it suggests, is in the movie.\n\nThat is the issue. It is not that Dominion does not deliver a great story (it does), it is that it does not deliver the story audiences were expecting, specifically by some of the promotions for the film.\n\nOn Twitter, a user asked Dominion director, Colin Trevorrow, why the scenes were cut, saying they were integral to the plot. Trevorrow responded, “Agree, but making movies is about compromise and hard choices. I promise you’ll see it that way soon…” This response seems to indicate there will be more of a delivery on the initial premise through some later release but that means that experience will not be delivered in this theatrical release.\n\nAs I said, this does not mean Dominion is a bad film. Anticipating it as much as I have since 2018, knowing this would end the trilogy, I avoided spoilers at all costs. This means I had no idea what to expect other than seeing the original cast (which is what really sells this final entry). Having no idea what the plot would be for this movie, I went along, not expecting anything other than dinosaurs and, as Ian Malcolm put it in The Lost World, “running and screaming\".\n\nWithout much in the way of expectations requiring fulfillment, I was really along for the ride and let Dominion take me where it was going.\n\nI’m glad that was the case.\n\nThis allowed me to enjoy a film that really delivered on some of the central themes touched on throughout the franchise, in a way preceding films had not. Dominion also does something Jurassic Park did exceptionally well - it makes a social and existential statement, without beating the audience over the head with it. In Jurassic Park the commentary about man playing God, wealth run amok, disregarding nature, and corporate greed putting us all at risk, is presented but not overdone. Jurassic World: Dominion manages to realistically depict where those themes would lead humanity when they converge, 30 years later, in the Jurassic universe (and potentially in ours). It does this without being preachy or going overboard.\n\nIt does quite a few other things well (including a rather impressively executed action sequence that involves a high-speed velociraptor chase) but for those hoping for the long-promoted premise of seeing dinosaurs living among us in our day to day lives, Dominion will likely fall flat. Those scenes are few and far between. However, for those that did not follow the franchise or promotions for the film closely enough to expect an actual Jurassic world, Dominion will be an excellent summer flick that completes both new and legacy character story arcs in a satisfying way, and has enough action sequence “teeth” for multiple viewings.", "authors": ["Jonathan Harris"], "publish_date": "2022/07/15"}, {"url": "https://www.fangoria.com/why-jurassic-world-the-video-game-is-the-best-sequel-in-the-franchise/", "title": "Why JURASSIC WORLD The Video Game Is The Best Sequel In ..."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8041270/reviews", "title": "Reviews: Jurassic World Dominion - IMDb"}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-chance-that-Jurassic-World-Dominion-will-be-the-best-of-the-franchise", "title": "Is there any chance that Jurassic World: Dominion will be the best of ..."}, {"url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-park-movies-in-order", "title": "How to Watch the Jurassic Park Movies in Chronological Order - IGN", "text": "Jurassic Park, created through the imaginative writing of novelist Michael Crichton and the filmmaking magic of Steven Spielberg, was one of the most beloved and successful movies of the ‘90s.

Scroll down to find out how to watch the Jurassic Park movies in order, by narrative chronologically or release date.\n\nJurassic Park Movies in Order 10 Images\n\nHow Many Jurassic Park Movies Are There?\n\nThere are six feature-length Jurassic movies — three Jurassic Park films and three Jurassic World films. The canon also includes two short films and an animated Netflix series, which we’ve included in the chronology below.\n\nJurassic World Ultimate Collection (4K UHD + Blu-ray + Digital) 4 See it at Amazon\n\nJurassic Park Movies in Chronological Order\n\nThese blurbs contain mild spoilers, including characters, settings, and broad plot points.\n\n1. Jurassic Park (1993)\n\nThe Jurassic Park chronology is largely straightforward as the feature films’ release order lines up with their chronological order — only the short films and Netflix series may require a bit of guidance.\n\nJurassic Park adapts the Michael Chrichton novel of the same name and sets up the series’ narrative conceit: Dinosaurs have been cloned by extracting DNA from prehistoric mosquitoes preserved in amber and a reckless entrepreneur (Richard Attenborough) is using the clones to fill a theme park on the fictitious island Isla Nublar.\n\nPaleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and mathematician/chaotician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) arrive on the island to assess the safety of the park. They’re joined on their tour by Lex and Tim Murphy, the grandchildren of Jurassic Park founder John Hammond.\n\nA tropical storm lands on the island and a saboteur kills the power to steal corporate secrets, resulting in a deactivated security system. With the dinosaurs now unrestrained, the island tour turns into a deadly escape mission against velociraptors and a Tyrannosaurus rex.\n\nRead IGN’s Jurassic Park review or preorder the 4K Edition of Jurrassic Park.\n\nWhere to Watch: Stream on Netflix, rent on Amazon Prime Video\n\n2. The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)\n\nSet and released four years after Jurassic Park, The Lost World brings back Goldblum’s Ian Malcolm and Attenborough’s John Hammond to star alongside Julianne Moore’s paleontologist Sarah Harding.\n\nThe Lost World is set on a second island, Isla Sorna, where Hammond also cloned dinosaurs. The island was ultimately abandoned and the dinosaurs were left to fend for themselves. A power struggle for control of Hammnod’s company, InGen, leads two opposing factions to Isla Sorna.\n\nOne faction, led by Hammond’s nephew Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard), wants to again try exploiting the dinosaurs for profit, while Hammond, Malcolm, and Harding aim to turn the island into a nature preserve where the creatures can be studied away from human interference.\n\nThe two sides struggle against the backdrop of uncaged, territorial dinosaurs, once again resulting in frenetic chase sequences and occasional death. The exploiters are successful in capturing a T-Rex to transport to a new park in San Diego, which escapes captivity and wreaks havoc on the city. Malcolm and Harding attempt to capture it nonlethally.\n\nRead IGN’s The Lost World: Jurassic Park review .\n\nWhere to Watch: Stream on Netflix, rent on Amazon Prime Video\n\n3. Jurassic Park 3 (2001)\n\nSam Neill reprises his role as Alan Grant for the series’ third film, with Laura Dern’s Ellie Sattler returning as well, albeit for a much smaller role. Another four years have passed between The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3 — both in the real world and in-universe chronology.\n\nJurassic Park 3 is once again set on Isla Sorna, where a man and a boy have gone missing. Grant, in need of money for his continued dinosaur research, accepts to give a helicopter tour of the island in exchange for funding. We learn the tour is actually a rescue mission chartered by the missing boy’s parents.\n\nAs expected, the dinosaurs welcome the humans with hostility. The group is pitted against a pack of velociraptors, which they must outsmart and outmaneuver while searching for the missing persons. Grant eventually contacts Settler to coordinate a rescue mission.\n\nThe end of Jurassic Park 3 began a 14-year hiatus for the franchise.\n\nRead IGN’s Jurassic Park 3 review .\n\nWhere to Watch: Stream on Netflix, rent on Amazon Prime Video\n\n4. Jurassic World (2015)\n\nSet and released 22 years after the original Jurassic Park, Jurassic World quickly became one of the highest grossing movies of all time after it's release. The film takes viewers back to Isla Nublar, where a new dinosaur theme park has opened. Jurassic World stars Chris Pratt as animal behavioralist/velociraptor trainer Owen Grady and Bryce Dallas Howard as Jurassic World operations manager Claire Dearing.\n\nClaire’s two nephews venture off on their own to explore the park, while a genetically modified mega-dinosaur, the Indominus rex, escapes captivity. Claire and Owen venture out to save the boys as the situation escalates and more dinosaurs join the fray.\n\nWith the boys safe, the action turns toward subduing the Indominus rex. Owen is tasked with confronting the beast with his trained velociraptors, which does not go according to plan. The climax of the film is an epic showdown between the Indominus and a T-Rex. The surviving humans flee and the great dinosaur theme park experiment is once again shuttered.\n\nRead IGN’s Jurassic World review .\n\nWhere to Watch: Stream on Jurassic World, rent on Amazon and other platforms\n\n4a. Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous (TV Series - 2020)\n\nJurassic World: Camp Cretaceous is a canonical, family-friendly animated Netflix series. It’s not essential viewing but we’re including it for those who want the complete Jurassic Park experience.\n\nCamp Cretaceous ran for five seasons and takes place during the events of the Jurassic World trilogy. The show follows six kids who attend Camp Cretaceous on Isla Nublar. The dinosaurs break free and the kids are left to survive on their own.\n\nThe show offers tons of references and connections to the films throughout — many of which have been chronicled by SYFY . Overall, Camp Cretaceous is less about moving the overall Jurassic World plot forward and more about experiencing the trilogy’s events from a different perspective.\n\nRead IGN’s Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous review .\n\nWhere to Watch: Stream on Netflix\n\n5. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018)\n\nAs you may have noticed by now, the real-life time gaps between Jurassic films aligns with the in-universe time gaps. As such, Falling Kingdom is set three years after Jurassic World. Fallen Kingdom continues to explore the dangers of exploiting dinosaurs for the sake of profit. Jeff Goldblum reprises his role as Ian Malcolm.\n\nA volcanic eruption threatens the lives of the dinosaurs of Isla Nublar. Malcolm promotes correcting for the unnatural creation of present-day dinosaurs by letting them die in the eruption; Claire Dearing lobbies to save the creatures through her Dinosaur Protection Group. When the U.S. Senate votes to let the dinosaurs die, Claire teams up with Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell) to save them. She recruits Owen Grady to support the cause.\n\nWe learn of ulterior motives within the rescue group and discover the series’ cloning technology has not been limited to dinosaurs. The film ends with many of the dinosaurs set free and humanity entering a new era – one in which the two species must co-exist.\n\nRead IGN’s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom review .\n\nWhere to Watch: Rent on Amazon and other platforms.\n\n6. Battle at Big Rock (Short Film - 2019)\n\nCo-written and directed by Jurassic World’s Colin Trevorrow, Battle at Big Rock is a 10-minute short film set between Fallen Kingdom and Dominion, specifically one year after Fallen Kingdom. It shows the first major confrontation between dinosaurs and humans following the events of Fallen Kingdom.\n\nThe 10-minute short ends with clips of other early human-dinosaur encounters.\n\nWhere to Watch: Stream on YouTube\n\n7. Jurassic World Dominion: The Prologue (Short Film - 2021)\n\nOriginally shot as the beginning of Jurassic World Dominion, The Prologue is a five-minute short that was edited out and made into an IMAX preview. It’s now available to view online as a standalone short film or as part of the Jurassic World Dominion extended edition.\n\nThe short opens 65 million years ago, showing creatures of the Cretaceous. A Giganotosaurus does battle with a T-Rex, and the loser has its blood sucked by a mosquito…. The back half of the short is set in the present day, where a helicopter pursues a loose T-Rex at a drive-in movie theater.\n\nWhere to Watch: Stream on YouTube\n\n8. Jurassic World Dominion (2022)\n\nGiven the recency of Dominion’s release, this plot synopsis is especially vague to avoid spoilers.\n\nThe last movie in the Jurassic World trilogy, Dominion explores the premise set up by Fallen Kingdom: a world in which humans and dinosaurs co-exist. It’s set four years after Fallen Kingdom and unites the most recognizable characters from the franchise’s two trilogies: Owen Grady (Pratt), Claire Dearing (Howard), Ian Malcolm (Goldblum), Alan Grant (Neill), and Ellie Sattler (Dern).\n\nThe integration of dinosaurs into nature had great ecological effects and led to great ethical dilemmas.

Entitled Jurassic World: Dominion (not loving that title…), the movie follows the fallout of dinosaurs being released into the wild at the end of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Though I am generally a critic of the franchise, there were some moments I found encouraging within the trailer. Having said that, this is still a Jurassic World movie; where there is good, there is also plenty of bad from the perspective of someone who loves dinosaurs (looking at you, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard). To “celebrate” its release, I will look at the good, the bad, and the ugly for both lovers and skeptics of the franchise.\n\nThe Good:\n\nI’ll confess that I was pleasantly surprised by this trailer. To start, the opening scene of dinosaurs running across a forest in winter was such a departure from the palm trees of Jurassic Park that it almost melted my heart (no pun intended). Dinosaurs thriving in frigid climates isn’t a work of fiction, so to see a change of scenery that reflects actual science was something I found interesting.\n\nThe more fascinating – and in many ways more satisfying – aspect of the trailer was the appearance of three new dinosaurs. I suppose I should say two dinosaurs and a pterosaur, but the point remains the same: their designs are awesome.\n\nLet’s start with everyone’s favourite dinosaur slasher, Therizinosaurus. After being teased in the initial promotional imagery for the film, the trailer gives us a brief glimpse at one of the strangest known dinosaurs. Equipped with meter-long claws, vertical posture, and an elongated and slender neck, their Therizinosaurus sure looks the part. Though there is one major issue to discuss, its overall appearance is great! They even got one thing correct that had never been done in these films before: feathers.\n\nOne of the major criticisms of the Jurassic World franchise was the absence of feathers. Well, not anymore. It’s almost like they heard the internet comments and decided to change because of it… funny how that works! Having said this, I believe this choice works to their advantage. Take for example the feathered raptor Pyroraptor. In its brief appearance, it looks simultaneously deadly and beautiful, proving once and for all that a dinosaur with feathers can be scary after all. Now if only they had done it sooner…\n\nThe last notable addition is the pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus. Its appearance is a welcome sight, with proto-feathers and an accurate head crest giving it a stunning design. Though the bright yellow beak is very Daffy Duck-like, the design is still beautiful. The presence of feathers once again proves that they have no impact on how scary these animals can be. If anything, they help add a layer of complexity to make the movie a more vibrant and exciting experience.\n\nLastly: Jeff Goldblum. Need I say more?\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe most common mistake in dinosaur movies is the alignment of their wrists. While humans have “pronated” wrists that face forwards, dinosaur wrists face to the side. If dinosaur hand were to face forwards, then their wrists would break – so not exactly the best proposition. Yet dinosaur movies continue to make this mistake, as evidenced by the hands of Therizinosaurus. You would think that the animators would try to get the wrists correct for a dinosaur whose most prominent feature is a set of terrifying claws, but apparently not. How unfortunate…\n\nThe other major problem has to do with Quetzalcoatlus’ size and abilities. While Quetzalcoatlus was a carnivore, it certainly wouldn’t have been able to stage an all-out attack on an airplane. Despite its massive size, Quetzalcoatlus only weighed a few hundred pounds due to hollow bones. In other words, I doubt that the beanpole pterosaur could tear apart an aircraft.\n\nSpeaking of massive size, the Jurassic World films love to exaggerate animal size. First, it was the mosasaur in Jurassic World, whose size may be over 5x larger than its extinct counterparts. Now it is Quetzalcoatlus whose size is far from what it was. By comparing it to the plane it assaults, we can estimate that the Jurassic World: Dominion Quetzalcoatlus has a wingspan somewhere between 23 and 30 meters long. This exceeds the actual wingspan of Quetzalcoatlus – estimated to be about 10-12 meters – by almost double, thus highlighting the overindulgence of size within these movies.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nIn the trailers closing moments, the human protagonists are brought face-to-face with the franchises last new dinosaur: Giganotosaurus. As it approaches, Dr. Alan Grant poses a poignant question: “Bigger, why do they always have to be bigger?” While he may be referring to the Giganotosaurus, this is a question we can ask of the whole franchise.\n\nAt every opportunity since the reboot of Jurassic World, the franchise has attempted to go bigger than necessary. For Giganotosaurus, this means that spines along its back and exaggerated horns are apparently necessary to make it scary. Do these features really add anything to its appearance? Does going out of the way to defy accuracy justify a slight intimidation factor? I certainly don’t think so, and while I am happy to see Giganotosaurus on the big screen, it certainly isn’t perfect.\n\nAll in all, I believe there is hope for Jurassic World: Dominion. The hybrid dinosaurs are gone, feathered dinosaurs are in, and it has the mythos of nostalgia behind it as well. If the new and (hopefully) accurate dinosaurs are depicted correctly, then an enjoyable and authentic dinosaur movie may be on the horizon.\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nI do not take credit for any images found in this article.\n\nAll images courtesy to Universal Pictures\n\nBrown, Matthew A., and Kevin Padian. “Preface.” Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, vol. 41, no. sup1, 2021, pp. 1–1., https://doi.org/10.1080/02724634.2020.1853560.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/13"}]}

Where does one end, and the other begin?\n\nThe key distinction appears to fall in the line between what Apple described as “world knowledge” and “personal context.” Where Apple Intelligence will excel is combining information about you and your relationships and using those insights to streamline your everyday workflows — calling up old photos from an event or helping you create stylized AI-generated images of your contacts. Much of the processing of this data will happen within the Apple ecosystem, either on your Apple device or in special cloud-based Apple servers.\n\nBy comparison, Apple’s integration with OpenAI will let you send specific queries about the wider world to ChatGPT. Apple said that while Apple Intelligence will understand a great deal about your personal life, other AI models — such as ChatGPT — may be better suited for responding to prompts related to more general information.\n\nAny prompts to ChatGPT will be sent to the platform on an opt-in basis — users will have to make a conscious decision to do so. You’ll also be able to use ChatGPT to create documents from within some Apple apps.\n\nFrom the sound of it, the partnership will simply create an easier way for Apple users to access ChatGPT rather than providing unique or distinct AI features to Apple devices. Notably, you’ll be able to use ChatGPT through Apple without creating a ChatGPT account, and any prompts sent to ChatGPT won’t be logged and your data won’t be stored, Apple said. The company added that it’s working on integrating other AI startups’ models, too.\n\nSo the two announcements could be seen as rather complementary.", "authors": ["Samantha Kelly Clare Duffy Brian Fung Aditi Sangal Michael Ballaban Paul Glader", "Samantha Kelly", "Clare Duffy", "Brian Fung", "Aditi Sangal", "Michael Ballaban", "Paul Glader", "Cnn'S Clare Duffy", "Cnn'S Samantha Kelly", "Cnn'S Ramishah Maruf"], "publish_date": "2024/06/10"}]}

Here's a timeline compiled by Bob Harig, from the initial reports of a rival league in January 2020 until now. We'll update this file as more news continues to develop.\n\n2020: The rival circuit idea takes hold\n\nJanuary: Reports first surface about the potential for a rival golf league that has been meeting with players and agents behind the scenes and touting an 18-event circuit with just 48 players, 12 teams and guaranteed pay. Initial ideas saw $10 million purses with no cuts and a windfall for 12 team captains. The concept was called the Premier Golf League.\n\nJan. 29: Phil Mickelson plays in the pro-am for the Saudi International, an event that is sanctioned by the European Tour. In his group is Majed Al-Sorour, CEO of the Saudi Golf Federation; Andy Gardiner, a director at Barclays Capital and a founder of the PGL; and Colin Neville of the Raine Group, also a backer of the PGL, which had Saudi Arabia backing as well through the Public Investment Fund.\n\nJan. 30: Greg Norman, who once tried to spearhead a rival league with the backing of Fox Sports, sees viability in the PGL a day after the pro-am in Saudi Arabia. “It’s just a matter of getting all the right components together, whether players stay together,\" says Norman, whose World Golf League in 1993-94 was thwarted by the PGA Tour. “With my original concept, some players loved it, and others didn’t like it. I had corporate, I had television but you need 100% of the pie to be together before we can bake it. From what I’m seeing here, this one has every chance of getting off the ground.\"\n\nGreg Norman tried to spearhead a rival league decades ago and is a central figure in one now. Paul Childs/USA TODAY Sports\n\nFeb. 11: Speaking at the Genesis Invitational, Tiger Woods says he’s been approached about the PGL. “My team’s been aware of it and we’ve delved into the details of it and trying to figure it out just like everyone else. We’ve been down this road before with World Golf Championships and other events being started. There’s a lot of information that we’re still looking at and whether it’s reality or not, but just like everybody else, we’re looking into it.\"\n\nAsked why he might even be interested, Woods said: “I think just like all events, you’re trying to get the top players to play more collectively. It’s one of the reasons why we instituted the World Golf Championships, because we were only getting (the top players) together five times a year, the four majors and the Players, and we wanted to showcase the top players on more than just those occasions. So this is a natural evolution, whether or not things like this are going to happen, but ideas like this are going to happen going forward, whether it’s now or any other time in the future.\"\n\nFeb. 18: A week later at the WGC-Mexico Championship, Rory McIlroy seemingly deals the PGL a serious blow: “The more I’ve thought about it, the more I don’t like it. The one thing as a professional golfer in my position that I value is the fact that I have autonomy and freedom over everything I do. I pick and choose—this is a perfect example. Some guys this week made the choice not to come to Mexico. If you go and play this other golf league, you’re not going to have that choice.\n\n\"I read a thing the other day where it said if you take the money they can tell you want to do. And I think that’s my thing, I’ve never been one for being told what to do, and I like to have that autonomy and freedom over my career, and I feel like I would give that up by going to play this other league. For me, I’m out. My position is I’m against it until there may come a day that I can’t be against it. If everyone else goes, I might not have a choice, but at this point, I don’t like what they’re proposing.\"\n\nSpring/Summer: Talk of the rival golf circuit dies down considerably amid the global Coronavirus pandemic. Talk shifts to when golf will resume and how it will take place amid a health crisis. The PGL idea goes into the background.\n\nFall: The PGL approaches the European Tour, now the DP World Tour, with a proposal to merge or cooperate. CEO Keith Pelley turns down the PGL and instead forms a \"strategic alliance\" with the PGA Tour that will see some crossover events, the Tour take an ownership stake in European Tour productions, and effectively—at the time—hold off the outside threat.\n\n2021: LIV Golf is born\n\nMay 4: A report surfaces that a new Super Golf League has emerged and that it is either the new name for the PGL or something different. Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson are among those linked to it. Sometime during the spring and summer of 2021, the PGL sees some of its personnel switch allegiances to a new entity that will have full Saudi backing and will come to be known as LIV Golf.\n\nOct. 27: At a private unveiling in New York, LIV Golf Investments is announced with Greg Norman as its CEO, with the idea of first helping to back golf in Asia with the $300 million investment in the Asian Tour, which will be used to finance a new elevated series of events called the International Series. It is eventually disclosed that Norman will also be the commissioner of a new tour called the LIV Golf League, with plans to launch in the spring of 2022.\n\nNov. 21: PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan sends a memo to players outlining how 55% of the Tour’s revenue will be paid out to players in the form of prize money, bonuses and other benefits—believed to be in response to Phil Mickelson saying on a podcast that only 26% of revenue was going to the players.\n\nEarly 2022: Phil Mickelson speaks, LIV prepares\n\nFeb. 2: While playing in the Saudi International for the third straight year, Phil Mickelson does an interview with Golf Digest in which he refers to the PGA Tour’s \"obnoxious greed\" as a reason why players might be interested in LIV Golf. He also maintains that the Tour is sitting on millions of dollars that should be going to the players. \"It’s not public knowledge, all that goes on,\" Mickelson said. “But the players don’t have access to their own media. If the Tour wanted to end any threat, they could just hand back the media rights to the players. But they would rather throw $25 million here and $40 million there than give back the roughly $20 billion in digital assets they control. Or give up access to the $50-plus million they make every year on their own media channel.\"\n\nPhil Mickelson set golf ablaze with comments early in 2022 accusing the PGA Tour of \"obnoxious greed,\" then after a hiatus emerged as one of LIV Golf's headliners. Paul Childs/USA TODAY Sports\n\nFeb. 17: Even Tiger Woods and the Genesis Invitational—where he is not playing—take a back seat to the drama that unfolds when Alan Shipnuck releases an excerpt from his soon-to-released biography of Phil Mickelson in which the golfer, among other things, says he is willing to use the Saudi-backed LIV Golf League as leverage against the PGA Tour and that he and other players paid attorneys to help LIV Golf develop its business plan.\n\nFeb. 20: With Phil Mickelson’s comments the talk of the tournament, players such as Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau come out in support of the PGA Tour, viewed as a blow to LIV Golf. It is later learned that Mickelson’s comments and the subsequent back-tracking of several players who were interested in LIV set back the league’s plans and sent it into disarray.\n\nFeb. 22: In the wake of his comments, Phil Mickelson offers an apology and says he will step away from the game for a period of time and offers to pause relationships with sponsors. “I have always known that criticism would come with exploring anything new. I still chose to put myself at the forefront of this to inspire change, taking the hits publicly to do the work behind the scenes.”\n\nMickelson said that he offered the brands with which he was associated “the option to pause or end the relationship as I understand it might be necessary given the current circumstances.” KPMG and Amstel Light end their relationships with Mickelson, and a few days later, Callaway announces that it is pausing a relationship that dates to 2004.\n\nMarch 8: With Phil Mickelson missing—and, later it was learned, suspended—PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan addressed the media at the Players Championship. A typical state-of-the tour-type news conference turned into questions about Mickelson and LIV Golf. \"The PGA Tour is moving on,\" he said. \"We have too much momentum and too much to accomplish to be consistently distracted by rumors of other golf leagues and their attempts to disrupt our players, our partners, and most importantly our fans from enjoying the Tour and the game we all love so much.\n\n\"I am grateful for the strong support our top players have shown recently and publicly, and I’m extremely proud that we’ve turned the conversation around to focus on what we do best: delivering world-class golf tournaments with the best players to the best fans, all while positively impacting the communities in which we play. We are and we always will be focused on legacy not leverage.\"\n\nMarch 16: Despite numerous setbacks, LIV Golf announces an eight-tournament schedule to begin in June. It won’t be the LIV Golf League, as planned, but the LIV Golf Invitational Series. Purses will be $20 million for the individual portion with $5 million more set aside for the teams. At the time, LIV Golf was unsure if it would be able to fill a 48-player field so it announced that the entire purse would be paid out regardless of the number of players who started. Total prize money for the eight events was set at $255 million, with $50 million set aside for a season-ending Team Championship.\n\nMay 10: PGA Tour players and Korn Ferry Tour players interested in competing in the first LIV Golf event outside of London in June need to seek conflicting event and/or media releases but are denied. The Tour tells players it is not an authorized event. Greg Norman, the LIV Golf commissioner, pushes back. \"Sadly, the PGA Tour seems intent on denying professional golfers their right to play golf, unless it’s exclusively in a PGA Tour tournament. This is particularly disappointing in light of the Tour’s non-profit status, where its mission is purportedly to promote the common interests of professional tournament golfers.\n\n\"Instead, the Tour is intent on perpetuating its illegal monopoly of what should be a free and open market. The Tour’s action is anti-golfer, anti-fan, and anti-competitive. But no matter what obstacles the PGA Tour puts in our way, we will not be stopped. We will continue to give players options that promote the great game of golf globally.”\n\nMid 2022: LIV Golf—with big names—tees off\n\nMay 31: Dustin Johnson, a two-time major winner who has 24 PGA Tour titles, headlines the field announced for the first LIV Golf event to be played at The Centurion Club outside of London. Others listed are past major winners Sergio Garcia and Louis Oosthuizen, as well as Kevin Na, Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood.\n\nJune 6: Phil Mickelson ends a four-month hiatus in which he missed the Masters and defense of his PGA Championship title, emerging as LIV Golf’s latest signee who is set to compete later in the week at the first tournament. At a news conference prior to the tournament, Mickelson is asked several times about his past comments regarding Saudi Arabia, its human rights record and the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, believed by U.S. government officials to have been carried out by the Saudi regime.\n\n“Well, certainly, I've made, said and done a lot of things that I regret, and I'm sorry for that and for the hurt that it's caused a lot of people. I don't—I don't condone human rights violations at all. Nobody here does, throughout the world. I'm certainly aware of what has happened with Jamal Khashoggi, and I think it's terrible. I've also seen the good that the game of golf has done throughout history, and I believe that LIV Golf is going to do a lot of good for the game as well. And I'm excited about this opportunity. That's why I'm here.\"\n\nJune 9: Within minutes of the first tee shots being struck at the first LIV Golf event, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan issues a memo in which players who are participating are told they are being suspended.\n\nCharl Schwartzel owns a unique piece of golf history: winner of the first LIV Golf event. Paul Childs/USA TODAY Sports\n\nJune 11: Charl Schwartzel, the 2011 Masters champion, wins the first LIV event, holding on for his first victory anywhere in nearly six years. The win was worth $4 million from the $20 million purse and because Schwartzel’s team, Stinger GC, won the team competition, he pocketed another $750,000 from the $3 million paid to the winners.\n\nJune 21: Following other players who committed to play for LIV during or after the first LIV event, then-four-time major champion Brooks Koepka is announced as the latest addition. He joins the likes of Bryson DeChambeau, Pat Perez, Patrick Reed and Abraham Ancer as those who were now set to play in LIV’s second event.\n\nJune 22: During a news conference at the Travelers Championship, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan outlines a plan that will see the PGA Tour return to a calendar-year schedule in 2024 while also increasing the purses substantially at eight events, including the legacy events for Tiger Woods, Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus. The FedEx Cup season is also changed to see smaller fields at the first two playoff events.\n\nAug. 2: Eleven LIV golfers sue the PGA Tour to challenge suspensions and claim a restraint of trade. Phil Mickelson and Bryson DeChambeau are among those named in the suit. Three other players—Talor Gooch, Hudson Swafford and Matt Jones—seek a temporary restraining order so they can play in the FedEx Cup playoffs. (The restraining order is denied on the eve of the FedEx Cup playoffs.)\n\nAug. 16: Tiger Woods flies to Delaware and heads a players-only meeting at the BMW Championship along with Rory McIlroy where details are hashed out that will lead to substantial purse increases and benefits for players. It would later commonly be referred to as \"the Delaware Meeting.\"\n\nAug. 24: On the back of the Delaware meeting, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan announces a hastily-devised plan that will see eight tournaments in 2023 with boosted purses. First called designated events, these tournaments would have $20 million purses except for the Sentry, which will be $15 million. For several of the events, the result means more than doubling the purse. For the legacy events, it means adding $8 million per event. And the first two playoff events will also have $20 million purses.\n\nAug. 30: Just more than a month after his victory at St. Andrews, British Open champion Cam Smith becomes the latest player to join LIV Golf, doing so in time for its event in Boston. Smith is joined by Joaquin Niemann, who attended the Delaware meeting, along with Marc Leishman, Harold Varner III, Anirban Lahiri and Cameron Tringale. At the time, it gave LIV Golf six of the top 30 players in the Official World Golf Ranking.\n\nOne month after winning the 150th British Open, Cam Smith left for LIV Golf. Michael Madrid/USA TODAY Sports\n\nOct 5: LIV Golf announces a strategic alliance with the MENA Tour, a developmental tour that has had Official World Golf Ranking accreditation since 2016. LIV Golf incorporates its events into the MENA Tour schedule and says it believes it should be granted OWGR immediately due to the association. The move is scoffed at as an end-around to try and obtain points and the OWGR does not grant points to LIV Golf.\n\nOct. 29: Martin Slumbers, the CEO of the R&A, makes it clear that the British Open is not going to ban LIV golfers who are otherwise eligible for the 2023 championship. \"We are not going to abandon 150 years of history have the Open not be open,\" Slumbers said.\n\nOct. 30: LIV Golf completes its first season with Dustin Johnson’s 4Aces team winning the team championship in Miami. The four team members share a $16 million payday.\n\nNov. 15: At the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai, Rory McIlroy says it is time for golf’s warring factions to figure something out. But he says it needs to happen without LIV Golf commissioner Greg Norman. “Greg needs to go. He needs to exit stage left. He’s made his mark but I think now is the right time to say you’ve got this thing off the ground but no one’s going to talk unless there’s an adult in the room that actually try to mend fences.\"\n\nNov. 29: At his Hero World Challenge event in the Bahamas, Tiger Woods also says that Greg Norman needs to go. Woods had been planning to play for the first time since the British Open but withdrew due to plantar fasciitis. “I think (Greg Norman) has to go, first of all, and then obviously the litigation against us and then our countersuit against them. Those would then have to be at a stay as well, then we can talk, we can all talk freely. Right now as it is, not right now, not with their leadership, not with Greg there and his animosity towards the tour itself. I don’t see that happening. But why would you change anything if you’ve got a lawsuit against you? They sued us first.\"\n\nAt his Hero World Challenge in 2022, Tiger Woods said Greg Norman would have to depart before a discussion could take place between the rival tours. Tracy Wilcox/Getty Images\n\nDec. 16: Only a year into the job, the Chief Operating Officer for LIV Golf leaves his position. Atul Khosla was hired by LIV Golf in December 2021 from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers NFL team, where he held the title of chief corporate development and brand officer. Khosla was also chief operating officer for the Chicago Fire soccer club in the MLS and also worked for General Electric and NBC Sports. In his role at LIV Golf, he reported to CEO and commissioner Greg Norman. His role was taken over by executives of the Performance 54 agency and not filled for nearly a year.\n\nDec. 20: Augusta National makes clear it will be inviting those eligible for the Masters to participate. “Regrettably, recent actions have divided men’s professional golf by diminishing the virtues of the game and the meaningful legacies of those who built it,\" Masters chairman Fred Ridley said in a statement. “Although we are disappointed in these developments, our focus is to honor the tradition of bringing together a preeminent field of golfers this coming April.”\n\nEarly 2023: OWGR, legal issues persist\n\nJan. 19: LIV Golf announces it has a long-awaited television partner after its events were available only via streaming in the first year. The CW Network—the C is for CBS, the W for Warner Media—enters into a multi-year agreement to televise LIV Golf tournaments. The deal will not see LIV Golf get paid a traditional rights fee but that is \"mutually financially beneficial.\" It is believed that LIV will share advertising revenue with the CW and will also likely be expected to shoulder a good bit of promotional work.\n\nJan. 24: Jay Monahan and Keith Pelley recuse themselves from reviewing LIV Golf’s application for Official World Golf Ranking points. Monahan, the commissioner of the PGA Tour, and Pelley, the CEO of the DP World Tour, are two of the seven members of the OWGR board of directors that ultimately decides the fate of tours seeking accreditation. Keith Waters, who heads up the International Federation of PGA Tours and is the DP World Tour’s chief operating officer, also recused himself from the application.\n\n“I have not looked at the LIV application,\" Pelley says during a session with reporters in Dubai. “So I can’t give an opinion on an application I have not seen. It is in the hands of the technical committee. On the advice of legal counsel, myself and Jay recused ourselves from the separate committee. Representatives of the four majors will now determine the LIV application. We are not involved and we have no influence on what transpires as far as LIV goes.\"\n\nApril 5: The DP World Tour wins an arbitration case against LIV Golf players who were seeking to play the former European Tour. The arbitration panel rules that the DP World Tour had the right to fine and suspend players for violating its membership regulations in order to compete in LIV Golf events. Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter and 10 other players had brought the action in response to fines levied for not being granted permission to compete in LIV Golf events. A separate antitrust case between LIV Golf and the PGA Tour is still scheduled for 2024.\n\nMay 4: Amid its investigation of former President Donald Trump’s handling of classified documents, the Department of Justice looks specifically at his dealings with LIV Golf, according to the New York Times. Two of Trump’s courses hosted events in 2022 with three scheduled to do so in 2023.\n\nSummer 2023: The stunning agreement\n\nJune 6: The golf world is stunned to learn that secret negotiations have been taking place and resulted in a \"framework agreement\" between the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and Public Investment Fund. Initially said to be a \"merger,\" it is later reframed as an agreement that would see the entities have an alliance. The biggest part of the news is that all of the lawsuits have been dropped. The idea is to have a final deal by Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nAs more details emerge, it is learned that PGA Tour Policy Board members Jimmy Dunne and Ed Herlihy secretly met with Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of the PIF, for several weeks prior to the announcement. PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan also had clandestine meetings with Al-Rumayyan. On the day of the announcement, they appeared together on CNBC.\n\nJune 7: While surprised that everything came together so quickly, Rory McIlroy says that the PGA Tour’s partnership with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia will ultimately be good for the game of golf. Speaking after his pro-am round at the RBC Canadian Open, McIlroy learned of the agreement shortly before the rest of the world but said much of it has been mischaracterized and that it should not be viewed as a merger with LIV Golf.\n\n“LIV has nothing to do with this. It’s the PGA Tour, the DP World Tour and the Public Investment Fund that are basically partnering to create a new company. That’s where I was a little frustrated. All I’ve wanted to do was protect the future of the PGA Tour and protect the aspirational nature of what the PGA Tour stands for. I think this does this. If you look at the structure, this new company sits above everything else. (PGA Tour commissioner) Jay (Monahan) on top of that. Technically, anyone involved with LIV would answer to Jay. The one thing whether you like it or not, the PIF were going to keep spending money in golf. At least the PGA Tour controls how that money is spent. You’re dealing with one of the biggest sovereign wealth funds in the world. Would you rather fight against or have them as a partner?\"\n\nJune 7: Although not involved in the negotiations, LIV Golf CEO and commissioner Greg Norman has a positive message for the staff. Norman, who was not mentioned in any of the news releases associated with the agreement, tells more than 100 people on a 30-minute call that LIV will see no operational changes and that work is already being done on a 2025 schedule. “The spigot is now wide open for commercial sponsorships, blue chip companies, TV networks. LIV is and will continue to be a standalone enterprise. Our business model will not change. We changed history and we’re not going anywhere.\"\n\nEight days after appearing with Yasir Al-Rumayyan on CNBC to announce the \"framework agreement,\" PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan took a leave of absence for health reasons. He later took responsibility for an \"ineffective\" rollout of the agreement which caught most PGA Tour players by surprise. John David Mercer/USA TODAY Sports\n\nJune 14: On the Tuesday of the U.S. Open week, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan announces through the Tour a health-related leave of absence that will see Tour executives Ron Price and Tyler Dennis take over his duties.\n\nJuly 7: In a memo to players, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan says he will return from his leave on July 14, which is the Monday of British Open week.\n\nJuly 9: Randall Stephenson, a longtime member of the PGA Tour and former head of AT&T, sends a resignation letter to Monahan and the board and specifically cites his displeasure with the framework agreement.\n\nJuly 11: Among wish-list ideas proposed by the LIV Golf League in the time leading up to the framework agreement was giving Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy LIV Golf League franchises and seeing them compete in LIV Golf events. It was just one of the ideas that discussed by the parties as part of documents released by a Senate subcommittee during a hearing in Washington, D.C., led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). The PGA Tour rejected it as part of the negotiation.\n\nThe committee is concerned about the foreign involvement in an American sports league as well as possible antitrust violations. Some of the ideas include having a \"World Golf Series\" team event that would be played in Saudi Arabia; LIV operating as it is but being played in the fall or with the idea of LIV coexisting along with the PGA Tour; two of the PGA Tour’s designated events that would be branded by the PIF or the Saudi Arabia oil company, Aramco.\n\nJuly 18: Masters champion Jon Rahm says he has no trust issues with PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan—unlike several of his peers—and suggests time is needed. “As it comes to what he's been doing for us and the PGA Tour, I think he's done a fantastic job. I would say it was unexpected what happened. I think what the management of the PGA Tour, the turn they took without us knowing was very unexpected, but I still think he's been doing a great job. And right now after that happened, I only think it's fair to give them the right time to work things out. I still think they have the best interest of the players at heart.\"\n\nRahm, speaking before the British Open, also reiterates he is not interested in LIV Golf. “We all had the chance to go to LIV and take the money and we chose to stay at the PGA Tour for whatever reason we chose. As I've said before, I already make an amazing living doing what I do. I'm extremely thankful, and that all happened because of the platform the PGA Tour provided me. As far as I'm concerned they've done enough for me, and their focus should be on improving the PGA Tour and the game of golf for the future generations.\"\n\nAug. 1: Tiger Woods is named to the PGA Tour Policy Board, giving the players a power boost as he becomes the sixth player director on the board. Part of the move includes a stipulation that will see a change in PGA Tour governance that means the player directors will have final say in any decisions going forward.\n\nAug. 8: PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan speaks with reporters for the first time since his leave and after returning to work and takes responsibility for the way the negotiations for the “framework agreement\" were secretly handled and the subsequent rollout. “It was ineffective and as a result there was a lot of misinformation. And anytime you have misinformation that can lead to mistrust. And that’s my responsibility. That’s me and me alone. I take full accountability for that. I apologize for putting players on their back foot. But ultimately it was the right move for the PGA Tour. I firmly believe that as we go forward time will bear that out. It was the right move and obviously we’re now in a position with NewCo (PGA Tour Enterprises) that provides the opportunity to have productive conversations.\"\n\nLate 2023: LIV strengthens its lineup\n\nOct. 19: On the eve of LIV Golf’s final event of 2023, CEO and commissioner Greg Norman speaks with reporters publicly for the first time since the agreement was announced and says he has \"zero\" concern about the future of the league, regardless of what happens with the “framework agreement.\"\n\n“All indications are showing that the position of LIV has never been stronger and that the success of our players and our brand has never been in a better place. And as we look forward into 2024, we’ve got a full schedule. We’ve got some places we’ve been to before, but we’ve got some new venues as well and we’re reaching different regions.\"\n\nNov. 28: Tiger Woods speaks publicly for the first time since the framework agreement was announced and he joined the Policy Board, touching a variety of subjects including outside Public Equity Investment in the PGA Tour, the Public Investment Fund and LIV Golf. He calls the ongoing negotiations \"murky\" and says \"I would have to say there's a lot of moving parts on how we're going to play. Whether it's here on the PGA Tour or it's merging, or team golf. There's a lot of different aspects that are being thrown out there all at once and we are trying to figure all that out and what is the best solution for all parties and best solution for all the players that are involved.’’\n\nHe says during the week and again two weeks later at the PNC Championship that he is focused on a deal getting done or some resolution by the Dec. 31 deadline.\n\nDec. 7: After weeks of speculation, Jon Rahm is announced as the newest member of LIV Golf. The two-time major champion, who on numerous occasions had expressed his disinterest in LIV due to the format, among other things, makes it official in New York where he said the lucrative offer was difficult to ignore and he had come to terms with the format. He also said his decision had nothing to do with any animosity or issues wit the PGA Tour.\n\n“I’m forever grateful to the PGA Tour and the platform they allowed me to be on. I have nothing bad to say about them. They allowed me the opportunity to play in some great events and allowed me to make a mark.\"\n\nDec. 31: The agreement deadline comes and goes but the PGA Tour says there is \"meaningful progress\" and that negotiations will continue into 2024.\n\n2024: PGA Tour lands an investor deal\n\nJan. 31: The PGA Tour announces the formation of PGA Tour Enterprises in a partnership with Strategic Sports Group, a group of investors from a number of professional sports. The deal, worth $3 billion, is said to allow nearly 200 PGA Tour players access to $1.5 billion in equity over time. The deal states that it allows for co-investment from the PIF in the future.\n\nMarch 12: Speaking with reporters for the first time since August, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said negotiations with the PIF are “accelerating” and that he and PGA Tour Policy Board members met with Yasir Al-Rumayyan in January, but did not offer specifics.", "authors": ["Bob Harig"], "publish_date": "2024/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/34063037/pga-tour-suspends-all-players-taking-part-first-liv-golf-tournament", "title": "PGA Tour suspends all players taking part in first LIV Golf tournament"}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/18dk1kd/i_dont_care_what_your_view_on_liv_or_pga_tour_is/", "title": "I don't care what your view on LIV or PGA TOUR is, can we all agree ..."}, {"url": "https://golf.com/news/pga-tour-greg-norman-liv-waivers-future/", "title": "The PGA Tour drew a line in the sand.

Now what?\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nShare by Email\n\nLIV Golf CEO Greg Norman and PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan seem to have their organizations set on a collision course. Getty Images\n\nAs the battle lines in men’s professional golf grow more defined, we know (to borrow from Andrew Brandt) one thing about what’s next: There will be lawyers.\n\nOn Tuesday, the PGA Tour denied permission for its players to compete in the LIV Golf Invitational in London next month. As first reported by Golfweek, the Tour informed its members who had applied for release late on Tuesday afternoon, shortly before its deadline to respond.\n\nLIV CEO Greg Norman fired back just a short while later, calling the Tour an “illegal monopoly” as well as “anti-golfer, anti-fan, and anti-competitive,” escalating the rhetoric and taking shots at the Tour’s mission and non-profit status.\n\nThe PGA Tour’s decision came as something of a surprise. Members are required to obtain releases for any non-PGA Tour events, but they have traditionally granted those releases to one-off events like the Saudi International. And while LIV Golf — the Saudi-backed breakaway tour helmed by Norman — has trumpeted this first event as the beginning of a “Series,” the structure of that series is currently eight one-off events requiring no yearlong commitments, at least for this year and next. Thus many players expected this first event to be treated similarly to the Saudi International.\n\nInstead, the conflict was expected to escalate several weeks later, when LIV heads to Pumpkin Ridge in Oregon. The PGA Tour does not grant releases within the United States and so that was expected to be the week players would have to plant their flags.\n\nInstead, the timeline has been moved up.\n\nWHY THE DENIAL?\n\nWhile the PGA Tour has not yet commented publicly on the decision, they seem to have determined that LIV’s plans for the future mean it should be treated differently than a one-off event.\n\nIt’s possible that decision was influenced by Norman’s latest announcements. He did multiple interviews on Tuesday during which he announced an influx of $2 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to be used for the 2022 and 2023 trial seasons and then for the official league launch in 2024 and 2025, when LIV plans to have 14-tournament schedules showcasing 12 four-player teams.\n\n“We have notified those who have applied that their request has been declined in according with the PGA Tour Tournament regulations,” wrote Tyler Dennis, PGA Tour senior vice president, in a message to Tour members that the Tour also published on its website. “As such, Tour members are not authorized to participate in the Saudi Golf League’s London event under our Regulations. As a membership organization, we believe this decision is in the best interest of the PGA Tour and its players.”\n\nThe Tour’s article on the subject noted that the Centurion event conflicts with the PGA Tour’s RBC Canadian Open, which is being held for the first time since 2019.\n\nAs a result, players hoping to dip their toes in the first event’s water have a decision to make: Do they maintain loyalty to the PGA Tour or choose to jump ship?\n\nWHAT WAS LIV’S RESPONSE?\n\nThe full statement from Norman came just after 8:30 p.m. ET and reads as follows:\n\n“Sadly, the PGA Tour seems intent on denying professional golfers their right to play golf, unless it’s exclusively in a PGA Tour tournament. This is particularly disappointing in light of the Tour’s non-profit status, where its mission is purportedly ‘to promote the common interests of professional tournament golfers.’ Instead, the Tour is intent on perpetuating its illegal monopoly of what should be a free and open market. The Tour’s action is anti-golfer, anti-fan, and anti-competitive. But no matter what obstacles the PGA Tour puts in our way, we will not be stopped. We will continue to give players options that promote the great game of golf globally.”\n\nWHO ARE THE PLAYERS IN QUESTION?\n\nPart of what makes this such a fluid situation is that we don’t have any comprehensive list of golfers who have applied for a release. The new series and its competitors are in a state of constant flux.\n\nNorman said earlier on Tuesday that among its 170 entries for the event at Centurion were 36 pros ranked inside the top 150 in the world, plus 19 in the top 100 and six in the top 50. But it’s not clear how many of those pros would still play given the Tour’s position.\n\nAmong those pros who have publicly confirmed they’d applied for waivers are Phil Mickelson, Lee Westwood and Sergio Garcia. Mickelson made the announcement through his agent, Steve Loy, who hedged the announcement with this caveat:\n\n“Phil currently has no concrete plans on when and where he will play. Any actions taken are in no way a reflection of a final decision made, but rather to keep all options open.”\n\nWestwood addressed his interest in a Sky Sports interview on the subject on the DP World Tour, pointing out the connections to Saudi Arabia in other sports like Formula 1, boxing and Premier League soccer.\n\nAnd Garcia expressed his interest via hot mic at last week’s Wells Fargo Championship, where he seemed to suggest he was eager to leave the PGA Tour when he exclaimed things like, “I can’t wait to leave this tour.” His agent later confirmed that he was among the Tour pros who had applied for a waiver.\n\nOther pros including former World No. 1 Martin Kaymer, DP World Tour veteran Richard Bland and Robert Garrigus have each applied for a waiver as well.\n\nWHAT’S NEXT\n\nSeveral things are going to happen at once.\n\nPGA Tour pros who have been denied releases will have to determine whether they’ll respect the Tour’s decision and stay, ignore the Tour’s decision and leave or pick some sort of middle ground where they explore legal options that would allow them to play both places.\n\nThe PGA Tour itself will have to determine its specific plan for sanctioning pros who follow through on plans to play a LIV event — and ready its defenses as its non-profit status and alleged “anti-competitive” nature come under fire.\n\nGiven LIV’s particular choice of words, it seems prepared for a legal battle. The organization also needs to determine whether it can move forward with plans to announce its list of committed pros, which was expected to come as early as next week. The waivers may have once again delayed that date.\n\nAnd other parties including the DP World Tour still need to determine where they stand on the matter and decide whether they, too, will deny members the ability to play at Centurion.\n\nIt’s all happening quickly now.\n\nThat means the lawyers are already hard at work.", "authors": ["Golf.Com Editor"], "publish_date": "2022/05/10"}, {"url": "https://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1862&context=sportslaw", "title": "Debating Outcomes of the Antitrust Challenges Between the PGA ..."}, {"url": "https://www.mssu.edu/news/2022/12/Staying%20in%20the%20Moment.php", "title": "STAYING IN THE MOMENT"}]}

Among nearly 3,000 employees, 71% reported feeling reduced levels of burnout; there were also improvements in physical health and wellbeing.\n\nIn many cases, firms that participated in the pilot, organised by non-profit 4 Day Week Global, reported their workers have been able to spend more time with their families, pursue hobbies and take greater personal care.\n\n“Our staff have had the intensity of their work ramp up following the pandemic and cost of living crisis,” explains Alison Dunn, chief executive of consumer-advice helpline Citizens Advice in Gateshead. “Burnout has been an issue, so the four-day week has given them space to decompress: we’ve had people spend their extra day off with their children, take forest walks and monetise their hobbies.”\n\nEmployers on the trial also say a truncated workweek has boosted productivity and output. “When people enjoy having an extra day off, that creates better work-life balance which, in turn, makes people happier and less stressed,” says Claire Daniels, CEO of Leeds-based digital marketing agency Trio Media. “And happier people perform better at work.”\n\nYet, despite these headline-grabbing results, the trial didn’t work for every business. Some firms abandoned the experiment; others haven’t yet made the move to adopt the format full-time. Even those firms continuing with reduced hours are navigating new challenges arising from shortened workweeks. Though this reflects a small portion of the trial’s participants, it means the four-day workweek isn’t an automatic solution for all.\n\nGetty Images Many businesses need to operate five days per week, which means it's harder to reduce staff days, or they need to hire extra workers for coverage (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n‘We couldn’t afford to give staff one day off every week’\n\nIn June 2022, Mark Roderick’s engineering and industrial supplies company Allcap joined the UK four-day workweek trial. After operating at full tilt through the pandemic, the managing director of the Gloucester-based firm hoped that the six-month pilot programme would mean being able to offer his 40-strong team extra rest days.\n\n“We rushed it through the business,” says Roderick. “We joined the programme late, and knew it would be a challenge implementing it across five sites. But we wanted to be able to give our staff time off during the summer.”\n\nRather than offer workers a three-day weekend like most of the 61 companies on the scheme, Allcap employees would have one workday off every fortnight. “We’re a trading business – customers call up all the time for manufacturing and construction components,” says Roderick. “We were already on a slightly reduced headcount, so we couldn’t afford to give staff one day off every week.”\n\nBut even with this bespoke four-day week model, Roderick says his firm quickly ran into problems. “As opposed to 10 normal workdays, we found that employees would have nine extreme ones – once they got to their scheduled day off they were exhausted. Once we factored in holidays, sickness and caring responsibilities, we also struggled to find cover for an employee on their rest day.”\n\nAs a result, Allcap abandoned its trial two months early at its three main trade sites (its warehouse and manufacturing centres have the resources to cope with a four-day week).\n\nAlongside staffing issues, Roderick says the nature of his industry has made the four-day week harder to implement. “If you’re in professional services, you often have project-based work that affords greater flexibility in meeting deadlines. Here, we have milling machines, a trade counter and around-the-clock deliveries – working from home is impossible, so you need a minimum number of staff on site, or you don’t have a business.”\n\nWorking from home is impossible, so you need a minimum number of staff on site, or you don’t have a business – Mark Roderick\n\nIndeed, as Allcap found, a typical trade-off for a three-day weekend is a more intense four-day workweek. “Without having a fifth day to catch up on work, there’s generally more stress now during the week in order to have a longer weekend,” says Laura White, projects and research manager at London-based charity Waterwise.\n\nAnd for businesses maintaining regular opening hours, a third day off for staff usually requires workers covering shifts – and subsequently increased workloads. “We found that when it was someone’s turn for their day off, the buck passed to a colleague, and they were left under pressure,” says Roderick. “Someone’s absence would come up to management, so we’d effectively have to just do daily tasks – our longer-term projects and strategic work went out the window.”\n\nWhere it can fall short\n\nFor some firms, particularly customer-facing businesses, creating enough slack in the schedule for a four-day week means extra hiring costs – making it prohibitive to move forward with a new model. Dunn says Citizens Advice in Gateshead invested in the equivalent of three additional full-time employees so 45 contact centre staff could join the trial. “We didn’t want a situation where someone would be excluded from the opportunity,” she adds.\n\nThese customer-facing firms often face greater challenges in maintaining four-day workweeks. “Some employees can work extended hours during the week to catch up in order to have that extra day off,” says Dunn. “But that’s not available to our contact centre team, who have clearly defined opening hours. Their work is heavily monitored with specific KPIs set by our funder that need to be delivered – currently, they can only make marginal gains.”\n\nLikewise, the demands of the job mean these workers have less flexibility in their third day off, says Dunn. “The busiest days at the contact centre are usually Mondays and Fridays, meaning it’s not possible for them to take time off either side of the weekend. The knock-on effect is that it leaves only three days left for staff to take their extra day off.”\n\nConversely, Dunn says employees outside the contact centre, who can work flexibly, have surpassed targets. “In those areas of the business, employees have knocked it out the park, exceeding KPIs and income projections. We’re left with a picture that’s not evenly spread.”\n\nGetty Images Companies comprising heavily customer-facing roles may have a hard time adapting to the four-day workweek as seamlessly as other firms (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nInstead of adopting or rejecting the new set-up outright, Dunn has extended Citizens Advice’s four-day week trial to May. She says unless targets are met by the contact centre team, it’s unlikely the shorter workweek will be made permanent in any part of the business. “We have 220 employees: I can’t imagine that we’d allow a four-day for some and not for others. Rather than size, the difficulties with the four-day week come in a business's complexity – when you have different ways of operating and offer varied services.”\n\nThe longer-term outlook\n\nAlongside Citizens Advice, Waterwise and Trio Media are also extending their trials. “Six months didn’t feel long enough to make a permanent decision,” says Daniels, of Trio. “We want to see how it feels over a full year, and to ensure productivity remains high.”\n\nSome other businesses on the scheme chose to forego a fixed four-day week, and instead offer more flexibility generally.\n\nIn one case, Jo Burns-Russell, CEO of Northampton-based creative agency Amplitude, has made the four-day week optional: employees now work a flexible, reduced 35-hour week that can be split across four or five days. “After the trial, everyone wanted to do their shorter workweek differently,” she says. “Rather than prescribe a day off, it’s better to let people choose what works best for them. As an agile company with a team of 12, it works well.”\n\nInstead of a fixed four-day approach, Abigail Marks, professor of the future of work at Newcastle University Business School, believes this model of shortened workweeks and flexibility could bring the biggest gains to the workforce. “Without reducing the intensity of workloads and tackling overworking more broadly, a mass scale four-day week risks intensifying already intense workloads,” she says. “A six-hour workday may be more effective than a four-day week among organisations that are able to do so.”\n\nAnd although 100% of firms in the trial didn’t immediately move to implement the model, the general success of the four-day week trial points to more employers acknowledging that the traditional nine-to-five isn’t working, says Marks. “It’s another experiment in the post-pandemic world of work. It’s showing that people are realising that long hours culture isn’t healthy or sustainable.”\n\nFor now, while a four-day week may be an experiment worth keeping on a permanent basis for some companies, it may not be realistic for all.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/19"}, {"url": "https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/03/four-day-work-week-uk-trial/", "title": "UK four day work week trial: What are the pros and cons? | World ..."}, {"url": "https://www.commonwealthfund.org/international-health-policy-center/countries/england", "title": "England | International Health Care System Profiles ..."}, {"url": "https://careers.ba.com/pilots", "title": "Pilots"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/06/thousands-workers-worlds-biggest-trial-four-day-week", "title": "Thousands of UK workers begin world's biggest trial of four-day week", "text": "More than 3,300 workers at 70 UK companies, ranging from a local chippy to large financial firms, start working a four-day week from Monday with no loss of pay in the world’s biggest trial of the new working pattern.\n\nThe pilot is running for six months and is being organised by 4 Day Week Global in partnership with the thinktank Autonomy, the 4 Day Week Campaign, and researchers at Cambridge University, Oxford University and Boston College.\n\nThe trial is based on the 100:80:100 model – 100% of pay for 80% of the time, in exchange for a commitment to maintain 100% productivity.\n\nPlatten’s Fish and Chips in Wells-next-the-Sea on the north Norfolk coast is participating, along with the Sheffield software firm Rivelin Robotics, the London-based inheritance tax specialists Stellar Asset Management, and Charity Bank in Tonbridge, Kent.\n\nJoe O’Connor, chief executive of the not-for-profit group 4 Day Week Global, said the UK was at the crest of the four-day week wave: “As we emerge from the pandemic, more and more companies are recognising that the new frontier for competition is quality of life, and that reduced-hour, output-focused working is the vehicle to give them a competitive edge.”\n\nSome of the other companies involved provide education, workplace consultancy, housing, skincare, building and construction recruitment services, food and beverages, and digital marketing.\n\nResearchers will work with each participating organisation to measure the impact on productivity in the business and the wellbeing of its workers, as well as the impact on the environment and gender equality.\n\nView image in fullscreen Wyatt Watts, team leader at Platten’s Fish and Chips, said morale had already improved within his team since the business joined the trial.

Photograph: Handout\n\nGovernment-backed four-day week trials are also due to begin later this year in Spain and Scotland.\n\nJuliet Schor, a professor of sociology at Boston College and lead researcher on the pilot, described it as a “historic trial”. “We’ll be analysing how employees respond to having an extra day off, in terms of stress and burnout, job and life satisfaction, health, sleep, energy use, travel and many other aspects of life,” she said.\n\n“The four-day week is generally considered to be a triple-dividend policy – helping employees, companies, and the climate. Our research efforts will be digging into all of this.”\n\nWyatt Watts, 25, team leader at Platten’s Fish and Chips, said: “When I first heard we were going to be working less hours with the same pay, I thought to myself, ‘What’s the catch?’ Usually I’m so exhausted from work I don’t have the energy, so hopefully having that extra time to rest will boost my energy levels.”\n\nHe said the decision to join the pilot was already having an impact. “Morale has improved and we’re hoping that our productivity at work is going to be higher.”\n\nEd Siegel, chief executive of Charity Bank, said it was proud to be one of the first banks in the UK to embrace the four-day week. “We have long been a champion of flexible working, but the pandemic really moved the goalposts in this regard. For Charity Bank, the move to a four-day week seems a natural next step.\n\n“The 20th-century concept of a five-day working week is no longer the best fit for 21st-century business.

US/Ireland (complete)\n\nIn 2022, 900 workers across 33 companies based in the US and Ireland took part in a four-day workweek trial over a six-month period.\n\nAccording to CNBC, participants rated the experience a 9.1 out of 10, while 97% said they wanted to keep the four-day workweek.\n\n4. Spain (complete)\n\nThe Spanish city of Valencia was the home of another recent trial which took place between April 10 and May 7 of 2023. The city’s council scheduled four local holidays on four consecutive Mondays, giving 360,000 participating workers an extra day off per week.\n\nThe study found that the arrangement was better for Spanish workers’ health and benefitted their children too. There were some other interesting, positive results, such as reduced fuel emissions due to less commuting.\n\n5.

However, the trend has yet to catch on nationwide.\n\n7. Canada (complete)\n\nIn 2022, Canada ran a four-day workweek trial involving 41 companies, most of which had 11-25 employees on their payroll.\n\nIn this study, it was up to the companies to decide how to reduce their hours – the only task was to ensure it didn’t negatively impact output.\n\nOut of those 41 companies, 35 reported that they were either planning to keep the change or leaning towards doing so.\n\n8. Portugal (ongoing)\n\nPortugal is one of the most recent nations to give a selection of their workforce the all-clear for a trial to take place. In June, a 6-month trial started involving 39 corporate businesses.\n\nAlmost three-quarters of Portuguese workers work more than 40 hours a week, so it’ll be fascinating to see how it affects productivity.\n\n9. Brazil (ongoing)\n\nBrazil’s four-day workweek trial is only just getting into full swing, having started on September 4, 2023. 20 companies are involved in the trial, and all of them employ more than 400 workers.\n\nHundreds of Brazilian businesses applied to participate in the study, but only a select few were chosen.

EDT\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Good evening, my fellow Americans. We’re facing an inflection point in history — one of those moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come. That’s what I’d like to talk with you about tonight.\n\n\n\nYou know, earlier this morning, I returned from Israel. They tell me I’m the first American president to travel there during a war.\n\n\n\nI met with the Prime Minister and members of his cabinet. And most movingly, I met with Israelis who had personally lived through horrific horror of the attack by Hamas on the 7th of October.\n\n\n\nMore than 1,300 people slaughtered in Israel, including at least 32 American citizens. Scores of innocents — from infants to elderly grandparents, Israelis, Americans — taken hostage.\n\n\n\nAs I told the families of Americans being held captive by Hamas, we’re pursuing every avenue to bring their loved ones home. As President, there is no higher priority for me than the safety of Americans held hostage.\n\n\n\nThe terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure, unadulterated evil in the world. But sadly, the Jewish people know, perhaps better than anyone, that there is no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on others.\n\n\n\nIn Israel, I saw a people who are strong, determined, resilient, and also angry, in shock, and in deep, deep pain.\n\n\n\nI also spoke with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and reiterated that the United States remains committed to the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and to self-determination. The actions of Hamas terrorists don’t take that right away.\n\n\n\nLike so many other, I am heartbroken by the tragic loss of Palestinian life, including the explosion at a hospital in Gaza — which was not done by the Israelis.\n\n\n\nWe mourn every innocent life lost. We can’t ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians who only want to live in peace and have an opportunity.\n\n\n\nYou know, the assault on Israel echoes nearly 20 months of war, tragedy, and brutality inflicted on the people of Ukraine — people that were very badly hurt since Putin launched his all-out invasion.\n\n\n\nWe’ve have not forgotten the mass graves, the bodies found bearing signs of torture, rape used as a weapon by the Russians, and thousands and thousands of Ukrainian children forcibly taken into Russia, stolen from their parents. It’s sick.\n\n\n\nHamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy — completely annihilate it.\n\n\n\nHamas — its stated purpose for existing is the destruction of the State of Israel and the murder of Jewish people.\n\n\n\nHamas does not represent the Palestinian people. Hamas uses Palestinian civilians as human shields, and innocent Palestinian families are suffering greatly because of them.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Putin denies Ukraine has or ever had real statehood. He claims the Soviet Union created Ukraine. And just two weeks ago, he told the world that if the United States and our allies withdraw — and if the United States withdraw, our allies will as well — military support for Ukraine, it would have, quote, “a week left to live.” But we’re not withdrawing.\n\n\n\nI know these conflicts can seem far away. And it’s natural to ask: Why does this matter to America?\n\n\n\nSo let me share with you why making sure Israel and Ukraine succeed is vital for America’s national security. You know, history has taught us that when terrorists don’t pay a price for their terror, when dictators don’t pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction. They keep going, and the cost and the threats to America and to the world keep rising.\n\n\n\nSo, if we don’t stop Putin’s appetite for power and control in Ukraine, he won’t limit himself just to Ukraine. He’s — Putin has already threated to “remind” — quote, “remind” Poland that their western land was a gift from Russia.\n\n\n\nOne of his top advisors, a former president of Russia, has called Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania Russia’s “Baltic provinces.” These are all NATO Allies.\n\n\n\nFor 75 years, NATO has kept peace in Europe and has been the cornerstone of American security. And if Putin attacks a NATO Ally, we will defend every inch of NATO which the treaty requires and calls for.\n\n\n\nWe will have something that we do not seek — make it clear: we do not seek — we do not seek to have American troops fighting in Russia or fighting against Russia.\n\n\n\nBeyond Europe, we know that our allies and, maybe most importantly, our adversaries and competitors are watching. They’re watching our response in Ukraine as well.\n\n\n\nAnd if we walk away and let Putin erase Ukraine’s independence, would-be aggressors around the world would be emboldened to try the same. The risk of conflict and chaos could spread in other parts of the world — in the Indo-Pacific, in the Middle East — especially in the Middle East.\n\n\n\nIran is — is supporting Russia’s U- — in Ukraine, and it’s supporting Hamas and other terrorist groups in the region. And we’ll continue to hold them accountable, I might add.\n\n\n\nThe United States and our partners across the region are working to build a better future for the Middle East, one where the Middle East is more stable, better connected to its neighbors, and — through innovative projects like the India-Middle East-Europe rail corridor that I announced this year at the summit of the world’s biggest economies. More predictable markets, more employment, less rage, less grievances, less war when connected. It benefits the people — it would benefit the people of the Middle East, and it would benefit us.\n\n\n\nAmerican leadership is what holds the world together. American alliances are what keep us, America, safe. American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with. To put all that at risk if we walk away from Ukraine, if we turn our backs on Israel, it’s just not worth it.\n\n\n\nThat’s why, tomorrow, I’m going to send to Congress an urgent budget request to fund America’s national security needs, to support our critical partners, including Israel and Ukraine.\n\n\n\nIt’s a smart investment that’s going to pay dividends for American security for generations, help us keep American troops out of harm’s way, help us build a world that is safer, more peaceful, and more prosperous for our children and grandchildren.\n\n\n\nIn Israel, we must make sure that they have what they need to protect their people today and always.\n\n\n\nThe security package I’m sending to Congress and asking Congress to do is an unprecedented commitment to Israel’s security that will sharpen Israel’s qualitative military edge, which we’ve committed to — the qualitative military edge.\n\n\n\nWe’re going to make sure Iron Dome continues to guard the skies over Israel. We’re going to make sure other hostile actors in the region know that Israel is stronger than ever and prevent this conflict from spreading.\n\n\n\nLook, at the same time, President [Prime Minister] Netanyahu and I discussed again yesterday the critical need for Israel to operate by the laws of war. That means protecting civilians in combat as best as they can. The people of Gaza urgently need food, water, and medicine.\n\n\n\nYesterday, in discussions with the leaders of Israel and Egypt, I secured an agreement for the first shipment of humanitarian assistance from the United Nations to Palestinian civilians in Gaza.\n\n\n\nIf Hamas does not divert or steal this shipment — these shipments, we’re going to provide an opening for sustained delivery of lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the Palestinians.\n\n\n\nAnd as I said in Israel: As hard as it is, we cannot give up on peace. We cannot give up on a two-state solution.\n\n\n\nIsrael and Palestinians equally deserve to live in safety, dignity, and peace.\n\n\n\nYou know, and here at home, we have to be honest with ourselves. In recent years, too much hate has been given too much oxygen, fueling racism, a rise in antisemitism and Islamicphobia [Islamophobia] right here in America.\n\n\n\nIt’s also intensified in the wake of recent events that led to the horrific threats and attacks that both shock us and break our hearts.\n\n\n\nOn October 7th, terror attacks have triggered deep scars and terrible memories in the Jewish community.\n\n\n\nToday, Jewish families worried about being targeted in school, wearing symbols of their faith walking down the street, or going out about their daily lives.\n\n\n\nYou know, I know many of you in the Muslim American community or the Arab American community, the Palestinian American community, and so many others are outraged and hurting, saying to yourselves, “Here we go again,” with Islamophobia and distrust we saw after 9/11.\n\n\n\nJust last week, a mother was brutally stabbed, a little boy — here in the United States — a little boy who had just turned six years old was murdered in their home outside of Chicago.\n\n\n\nHis name was Wadea — Wadea — a proud American, a proud Palestinian American family.\n\n\n\nWe can’t stand by and stand silent when this happens. We must, without equivocation, denounce antisemitism. We must also, without equivocation, denounce Islamophobia.\n\n\n\nAnd to all of you hurting — those of you who are hurting, I want you to know: I see you. You belong. And I want to say this to you: You’re all America. You’re all America.\n\n\n\nThis is in a moment where there’s — you know, in moments like these, when fear and suspicion, anger and rage run hard, that we have to work harder than ever to hold on to the values that make us who we are.\n\n\n\nWe’re a nation of religious freedom, freedom of expression. We all have a right to debate and disagree without fear of being targeted at schools or workplaces or in our communities.\n\n\n\nAnd we must renounce violence and vitriol, see each other not as enemies but as — but as fellow Americans.\n\n\n\nWhen I was in Israel yesterday, I said that when America experienced the hell of 9/11, we felt enraged as well. While we sought and got justice, we made mistakes. So, I cautioned the government of Israel not to be blinded by rage.\n\n\n\nAnd here in America, let us not forget who we are. We reject all forms — all forms of hate, whether against Muslims, Jews, or anyone. That’s what great nations do, and we are great nation.\n\n\n\nOn Ukraine, I’m asking Congress to make sure we can continue to send Ukraine the weapons they need to defend themselves and their country without interruption so Ukraine can stop Putin’s brutality in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nThey are succeeding.\n\n\n\nWhen Putin invaded Ukraine, he thought he would take Kyiv and all of Ukraine in a matter of days. Well, over a year later, Putin has failed, and he continues to fail. Kyiv still stands because of the bravery of the Ukrainian people.\n\n\n\nUkraine has regained more than 50 percent of the territory\n\nRussian troops once occupied, backed by a U.S.-led coalition of more than 50 countries around the world all doing its part to support Kyiv.\n\n\n\nWhat would happen if we walked away? We are the essential nation.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Putin has turned to Iran and North Korea to buy attack drones and ammunition to terrorize Ukrainian cities and people.\n\n\n\nFrom the outset, I have said I will not send American troops to fight in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nAll Ukraine is asking for is help — for the weapons, munitions, the capacity, the capability to push invading Russian forces off their land, and the air defense systems to shoot down Russian missiles before they destroy Ukrainian cities.\n\n\n\nAnd let me be clear about something: We send Ukraine equipment sitting in our stockpiles. And when we use the money allocated by Congress, we use it to replenish our own stores — our own stockpiles with new equipment — equipment that defe- — that defends America and is made in America: Patriot missiles for air defense batteries made in Arizona; artillery shells manufactured in 12 states across the country — in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas; and so much more.\n\n\n\nYou know, just as in World War Two, today, patriotic American workers are building the arsenal of democracy and serving the cause of freedom.\n\n\n\nLet me close with this. Earlier this year, I boarded Air Force One for a secret flight to Poland. There, I boarded a train with blacked-out windows for a 10-hour ride each way to Kyiv to stand with the people of Ukraine ahead of the one-year anniversary of their brave fight against Putin.\n\n\n\nI’m told I was the first American [president] to enter a warzone not controlled by the United States military since President Lincoln.\n\n\n\nWith me was just a small group of security personnel and a few advisors.\n\n\n\nBut when I exited that train and met Zelenskyy — President Zelenskyy, I didn’t feel alone. I was bringing with me\n\nthe idea of America, the promise of America to the people who are today fighting for the same things we fought for 250 years ago: freedom, independence, self-determination.\n\n\n\nAnd as I walked through Kyiv with President Zelenskyy, with air raid sirens sounding in the distance, I felt something I’ve always believed more strongly than ever before: America is a beacon to the world still. Still.\n\n\n\nWe are, as my friend Madeleine Albright said, “the indispensable nation.”\n\n\n\nTonight, there are innocent people all over the world who hope because of us, who believe in a better life because of us, who are desperate not be forgotten be- — by us, and who are waiting for us.\n\n\n\nBut time is of the essence.\n\n\n\nI know we have our divisions at home. We have to get past them. We can’t let petty, partisan, angry politics get in the way of our responsibilities as a great nation.\n\n\n\nWe cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin win. I refuse to let that happen.\n\n\n\nIn moments like these, we have to remind — we have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America — the United States of America. And there is nothing — nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.\n\n\n\nMy fellow Americans, thank you for your time.\n\n\n\nMay God bless you all. And may God protect our troops.\n\n\n\n8:17 P.M.

There is a sense that perhaps there is a viable path forward.

I came here to take meetings with elected officials on both sides of the aisle. We came here to speak to them, to speak with them, and to urge them to speak with each other -- to remind and inspire them that the American people will continue to drive forward the mission of keeping our children safe, because it's more than our right to do so, it's our responsibility to do so.\n\nI'm here today in the hopes of applying what energy, reason, and passion that I have into trying to turn this moment into a reality. Because as I said, this moment is different. We are in a window of opportunity right now that we have not been in before, a window where it seems like real change -- real change can happen.\n\n'This moment is different':Matthew McConaughey urges leaders to address gun violence in White House speech\n\nUvalde, Texas, is where I was born. It’s where my mom taught kindergarten less than a mile from Robb Elementary. Uvalde is where I learned to master a Daisy BB gun. I took that -- that took two years before I graduated to a 410 shotgun. Uvalde is where I was taught to revere the power and the capability of the tool that we call a gun. Uvalde is where I learned responsible gun ownership.\n\nAnd Uvalde called me on May 24th, when I learned the news of this devastating tragedy. I had been out of cellular range working in the studio all day when I emerged and messages about a mass shooting in the town I was born in began flooding my inbox.\n\nIn a bit of shock, I drove home, hugged my children a bit tighter and longer than the night before, and then the reality of what had happened that day in the town I was born in set in.\n\nMore:Matthew McConaughey calls for 'gun responsibility' in op-ed after Uvalde school shooting\n\nSo the next morning, Camila, myself, and the kids, we loaded up the truck and drove to Uvalde. And when we arrived a few hours later, I got to tell you, even from the inside of our vehicle, you could feel the shock in the town. You could feel the pain, the denial, the disillusion, anger, blame, sadness, loss of lives, dreams halted.\n\nWe saw ministries. We saw first responders, counselors, cooks, families trying to grieve without it being on the frontpage news.\n\nWe met with the local funeral director and countless morticians who -- who hadn’t slept since the massacre the day before because they’d been working 24/7 trying to handle so many bodies at once -- so many little, innocent bodies who had their entire lives still yet to live.\n\nAnd that is there that we met two of the grieving parents, Ryan and Jessica Ramirez. Their 10-year-old daughter, Alithia -- she was one of the 19 children that were killed the day before.\n\nNow, Alithia -- her dream was to go to art school in Paris and one day share her art with the world. Ryan and Jessica were eager to share Alithia’s art with us, and said if we could share it, then somehow maybe that would make Alithia smile in heaven. They told us that showing someone else Alithia’s art would in some way keep her alive.\n\nNow, this particular drawing is a -- is a self-portrait of Alithia drawing, with her friend in heaven looking down on her drawing the very same picture. Her mother said, of this drawing -- she said, “You know, we never really talked to her about heaven before, but somehow she knew.”\n\nAlithia was 10 years old.\n\n'You could feel the pain':Matthew McConaughey on his visit to Uvalde after mass shooting\n\nHer father, Ryan -- this man was steady. He was uncommonly together and calm. When a frazzled friend of his came up and said, “How are you so calm? I'd be going crazy,” Ryan told him -- he said, “No, you wouldn't. No, you wouldn't. You’d be strong for your wife and kids, because if they see you go crazy, that will not help them.”\n\nJust a week prior, Ryan got a full-time line job stringing powerlines from pole to pole. And every day since landing that well-paying, full-time job, he reminded his daughter, Alithia -- he said, “Girl, Daddy going to spoil you now.” Told her every single night. He said, “Daddy is going to take you to SeaWorld one day.\n\nBut he didn’t get to -- he didn't get to spoil his daughter, Alithia. She did not get to go to SeaWorld.\n\nWe also met Ana and Dani- -- Danilo, the mom and the stepdad of nine-year-old Maite Rodriguez. And Maite wanted to be a marine biologist. She was already in contact with Corpus Christi University of A&M for her future college enrollment. Nine years old.\n\nMaite cared for the environment so strongly that when the city asked her mother if they could release some balloons into the sky in her memory, her mom said, “Oh no, Maite wouldn't want to litter.”\n\nMaite wore green high-top Converse with a heart she had hand-drawn on the right toe because they represented her love of nature.\n\nCamila has got these shoes. Can you show these shoes, please?\n\nWore these every day. Green Converse with a heart on the right toe. These are the same green Converse on her feet that turned out to be the only clear evidence that could identify her after the shooting. How about that?\n\nMaite wrote a letter. Her mom said if Maite’s letter could help someone accomplish her dream, that then her death would have an impact, and it would mean her dying had a point and wasn’t pointless -- that it would make the loss of her life matter.\n\nThe letter reads: “Marine biologist. I want to pass school to get to my dream college. My dream college is in Corpus Christi, by the ocean. I need to live next to the ocean because I want to be a marine biologist. Marine biologists study animals and the water. Most of the time, I will be in a lab. Sometimes, I will be on TV.”\n\nThen there was Ellie Garcia, a 10-year-old, and her parents, Steven and Jennifer.\n\nEllie loved to dance, and she loved church. She even knew how to drive tractors and was already working with her dad and her uncle mowing yards.\n\n“Ellie was always giving of her gifts, her time, even half-eaten food on her plate,” they said. They said, “Around the house, we’d call her the ‘great re-gifter.’” Smiling through tears, her family told us how Ellie loved to embrace. Said she was the biggest hugger in the family.\n\nNow, Ellie was born Catholic, but had been going to Baptist church with her uncle for the last couple of years. Her mom and dad were proud of her because, they said, “She was learning to love God, no matter where.”\n\nThe week prior to her passing, she had been preparing to read a verse from the Bible for the next Wednesday night's church service. The verse was from Deuteronomy 6:5. “And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might.”\n\nThat's who Ellie was becoming. But she never got to read it. Service is on a Wednesday night.\n\nThen there was the fairytale love story of a teacher named Irma and her husband, Joe. What a great family this was. This was an amazing family.\n\nCamila and I, we -- we sat with about 20 of their family members in the living room, along with their four kids. They were -- the kids were 23, 19, 15, and 13. They -- they shared all these stories about Irma and Joe -- served the community and would host all these parties, and how Irma and Joe were planning on getting a food truck together when they soon retired.\n\nThey were humble, hardworking people. Irma was a teacher, who, her family said, “went above and beyond, and just couldn't say no to any kind of teaching.” Joe had been commuting to and from work 70 miles away in Del Rio for years.\n\nTogether, they were the glue of the family. Both worked overtime to support their four kids. Irma even worked every summer when school was out. The money she had made two summers ago paid to -- paid to paint the front of the house. The money she made last summer paid to paint the sides of the house. This summer’s work was going to pay to paint the back of the house.\n\nMore:Matthew McConaughey explains why he's staying out of politics 'at this point' in his life\n\nBecause Irma was one of the teachers who was gunned down in the classroom, Joe, her husband, literally died of heartache the very next day when he had a heart attack.\n\nThey never got to paint the back of the house, they never got to retire, and they never got to get that food truck together.\n\nWe also met a cosmetologist. All right? She was well versed in mortuary makeup. That's the task of making the victims appear as peaceful and natural as possible for their open-casket viewings.\n\nThese bodies were very different. They needed much more than makeup to be presentable. They needed extensive restoration. Why? Due to the exceptionally large exit wounds of an AR-15 rifle. Most of the bodies so mutilated that only DNA tests or green Converse could identify them. Many children were left not only dead, but hollow.\n\nSo yes, counselors are going to be needed in Uvalde for a long time. Counselors are needed in all these places where these mass shooters have been for a long time.\n\nI was told by many that it takes a good year before people even understand what to do next. And even then, when they become se- -- secure enough to take the first step forward, a lifetime is not going to heal those wounds.\n\nAgain, you know what every one of these parents wanted, what they asked us for? What every parent separately expressed in their own way to Camila and me? That they want their children's dreams to live on. That they want their children's dreams to continue to accomplish something after they are gone. They want to make their loss of life matter.\n\nLook, we heard from -- we heard from so many people, all right? Families of the deceased -- mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers. Texas Rangers, hunters, Border Patrol, and responsible gun owners who won't give up their Second Amendment right to bear arms. And you know what they all said? “We want secure and safe schools, and we want gun laws that won't make it so easy for the bad guys to get these damn guns.”\n\nSo, we know what's on the table. We need to invest in mental healthcare. We need safer schools. We need to restrain sensationalized media coverage. We need to restore our family values. We need to restore our American values. And we need responsible gun ownership -- responsible gun ownership.\n\nWe need background checks. We need to raise the minimum age to purchase an AR-15 rifle to 21. We need a waiting period for those rifles. We need red-flag laws and consequences for those who abuse them.\n\nThese are reasonable, practical, tactical regulations to our nation, states, communities, schools, and homes.\n\nResponsible gun owners are fed up with the Second Amendment being abused and hijacked by some deranged individuals.\n\nThese regulations are not a step back; they’re a step forward for a civil society and -- and the Second Amendment.\n\nLook, is this a cure-all? Hell no.\n\nBut people are hurting -- families are, parents are. And look, as -- as divided as our country is, this gun responsibility issue is one that we agree on more than we don't. It really is. But this should be a nonpartisan issue. This should not be a partisan issue.\n\nThere is not a Democratic or Republican value in one single act of these shooters. It's not.\n\nBut people in power have failed to act. So we're asking you and I'm asking you, will you please ask yourselves: Can both sides rise above? Can both sides see beyond the political problem at hand and admit that we have a life preservation problem on our hands?\n\nBecause we got a chance right now to reach for and to grasp a higher ground above our political affiliations, a chance to make a choice that does more than protect your party, a chance to make a choice that protects our country now and for the next generation.\n\nWe got to take a sober, humble, and honest look in the mirror and re- -- rebrand ourselves based on what we truly value. What we truly value.\n\nWe got to get some real courage and honor our immortal obligations instead of our party affiliations.\n\nEnough with the counterpunching. Enough of the invalidation of the other side. Let's come to the common table that represents the American people. Find a mil- -- middle ground, the place where most of us Americans live anyway, especially on this issue.\n\nBecause I promise you, America -- you and me, who -- we are not as divided as we're being told we are. No.\n\nHow about we get inspired? Give ourselves just cause to revere our future again. Maybe set an example for our children, give us reason to tell them, “Hey, listen and watch these men and women. These are great American leaders right here. Hope you grow up to be like them.”\n\nAnd let's admit it: We can't truly be leaders if we're only living for reelection.\n\nLet’s be knowledgeable and wise, and act on what we truly believe.\n\nMore:Half of Republicans support stricter gun laws, a double-digit jump in a year, USA TODAY/Ipsos poll says\n\nAgain, we got to look in the mirror, lead with humility, and acknowledge the values that are inherent to but also above politics. We’ve got to make choices, make stands, embrace new ideas, and preserve the traditions that can create true -- true progress for the next generation.\n\nWith real leadership, let's start giving us -- all of us, with real leadership -- let's start giving all of us good reason to believe that the American Dream is not an illusion.\n\nSo where do we start? We start by making the right choices on the issue that is in front of us today.\n\nWe start by making laws that save innocent lives and don't infringe on our Second Amendment rights. We start right now by voting to pass policies that can keep us from having as many Columbines, Sandy Hooks, Parklands, Las Vegases, Buffaloes, and Uvaldes from here on.\n\nWe start by giving Alithia the chance to be spoiled by her dad.\n\nWe start by giving Maite a chance to become a marine biologist.\n\nWe start by giving Ellie a chance to read her Bible verse at the Wednesday night service.\n\nWe start by giving Irma and Joe a chance to finish painting their house, maybe retire and get that food truck.\n\nWe start by giving Makenna, Layla, Maranda, Nevaeh, Jose, Xavier, Tess, Rojelio, Eliahna, Annabell, Jackie, Uziyah, Jayce, Jailah, Eva, Amerie, and Lexi -- we start by giving all of them our promise that their dreams are not going to be forgotten.\n\nWe start by making the loss of these lives matter.\n\nThank you.

Madam Vice President. Our First Lady and Second Gentleman.\n\nMembers of Congress and the Cabinet. Leaders of our military.\n\nMr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme Court.\n\nAnd you, my fellow Americans.\n\nI start tonight by congratulating the members of the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nMr. Speaker, I look forward to working together.\n\nI also want to congratulate the new leader of the House Democrats and the first Black House Minority Leader in history, Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nCongratulations to the longest serving Senate Leader in history, Mitch McConnell.\n\nAnd congratulations to Chuck Schumer for another term as Senate Majority Leader, this time with an even bigger majority.\n\nAnd I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of this country, Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThe story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up.\n\nA story that is unique among all nations.\n\nWe are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it.\n\nThat is what we are doing again.\n\nTwo years ago, our economy was reeling.\n\nAs I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.\n\nTwo years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much.\n\nToday, COVID no longer controls our lives.\n\nAnd two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War.\n\nToday, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.\n\nAs we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America, I define our country in one word: Possibilities.\n\nYou know, we’re often told that Democrats and Republicans can’t work together.\n\nBut over these past two years, we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrong.\n\nYes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats had to go it alone.\n\nBut time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together.\n\nCame together to defend a stronger and safer Europe.\n\nCame together to pass a once-in-a-generation infrastructure law, building bridges to connect our nation and people.\n\nCame together to pass one of the most significant laws ever, helping veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.\n\nIn fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President. From reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, to the Electoral Count Reform Act, to the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love.\n\nTo my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can’t work together in this new Congress.\n\nThe people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.\n\nAnd that’s always been my vision for our country.\n\nTo restore the soul of the nation.\n\nTo rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class.\n\nTo unite the country.\n\nWe’ve been sent here to finish the job.\n\nFor decades, the middle class was hollowed out.\n\nToo many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down.\n\nOnce-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be.\n\nAnd along the way, something else was lost.\n\nPride. That sense of self-worth.\n\nI ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do.\n\nTo build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.\n\nAs my Dad used to say, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey –it’s going to be OK,” and mean it.\n\nSo, let’s look at the results. Unemployment rate at 3.4%, a 50-year low. Near record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers.\n\nWe’ve already created 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years.\n\nWhere is it written that America can’t lead the world in manufacturing again?\n\nFor too many decades, we imported products and exported jobs.\n\nNow, thanks to all we’ve done, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs.\n\nInflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted supply chains and Putin’s war that disrupted energy and food supplies.\n\nBut we’re better positioned than any country on Earth.\n\nWe have more to do, but here at home, inflation is coming down.\n\nHere at home, gas prices are down $1.50 a gallon since their peak.\n\nFood inflation is coming down.\n\nInflation has fallen every month for the last six months while take home pay has gone up.\n\nAdditionally, over the last two years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start a new small business.\n\nEvery time somebody starts a small business, it’s an act of hope.\n\nAnd the Vice President will continue her work to ensure more small businesses can access capital and the historic laws we enacted.\n\nStanding here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibility.\n\nSemiconductors, the small computer chips the size of your fingertip that power everything from cellphones to automobiles, and so much more. These chips were invented right here in America.\n\nAmerica used to make nearly 40% of the world’s chips.\n\nBut in the last few decades, we lost our edge and we’re down to producing only 10%. We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories overseas shut down.\n\nToday’s automobiles need up to 3,000 chips each, but American automakers couldn’t make enough cars because there weren’t enough chips.\n\nCar prices went up. So did everything from refrigerators to cellphones.\n\nWe can never let that happen again.\n\nThat’s why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nWe’re making sure the supply chain for America begins in America.\n\nWe’ve already created 800,000 manufacturing jobs even without this law.\n\nWith this new law, we will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country.\n\nThat’s going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investments in American manufacturing in the last two years.\n\nOutside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres – a literal field of dreams.\n\nThat’ll create 10,000 jobs. 7,000 construction jobs. 3,000 jobs once the factories are finished.\n\nJobs paying $130,000 a year, and many don’t require a college degree.\n\nJobs where people don’t have to leave home in search of opportunity.\n\nAnd it’s just getting started.\n\nThink about the new homes, new small businesses, and so much more that will come to life.\n\nTalk to mayors and Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they’ll tell you what this means to their communities.\n\nWe’re seeing these fields of dreams transform the heartland.\n\nBut to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we also need the best infrastructure in the world.\n\nWe used to be #1 in the world in infrastructure, then we fell to #13th.\n\nNow we’re coming back because we came together to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System.\n\nAlready, we’ve funded over 20,000 projects, including at major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland.\n\nThese projects will put hundreds of thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways, bridges, railroads, tunnels, ports and airports, clean water, and high-speed internet across America.\n\nUrban. Suburban. Rural. Tribal.\n\nAnd we’re just getting started. I sincerely thank my Republican friends who voted for the law.\n\nAnd to my Republican friends who voted against it but still ask to fund projects in their districts, don’t worry.\n\nI promised to be the president for all Americans.\n\nWe’ll fund your projects. And I’ll see you at the ground-breaking.\n\nThis law will help further unite all of America.\n\nMajor projects like the Brent Spence bridge between Kentucky and Ohio over the Ohio River. Built 60 years ago. Badly in need of repairs.\n\nOne of the nation’s most congested freight routes carrying $2 billion worth of freight every day. Folks have been talking about fixing it for decades, but we’re finally going to get it done.\n\nI went there last month with Democrats and Republicans from both states to deliver $1.6 billion for this project.\n\nWhile I was there, I met an ironworker named Sara, who is here tonight.\n\nFor 30 years, she’s been a proud member of Ironworkers Local 44, known as the “cowboys of the sky” who built the Cincinnati skyline.\n\nSara said she can’t wait to be ten stories above the Ohio River building that new bridge. That’s pride.\n\nThat’s what we’re also building – Pride.\n\nWe’re also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and childcare centers, so every child in America can drink clean water.\n\nWe’re making sure that every community has access to affordable, high-speed internet.\n\nNo parent should have to drive to a McDonald’s parking lot so their kid can do their homework online.\n\nAnd when we do these projects, we’re going to Buy American.\n\nBuy American has been the law of the land since 1933. But for too long, past administrations have found ways to get around it.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nTonight, I’m also announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.\n\nAmerican-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables.\n\nAnd on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.\n\nMy economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible.\n\nMaybe that’s you, watching at home.\n\nYou remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away.\n\nI get it.\n\nThat’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind.\n\nJobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.\n\nFor example, too many of you lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, wondering what will happen if your spouse gets cancer, your child gets sick, or if something happens to you.\n\nWill you have the money to pay your medical bills? Will you have to sell the house?\n\nI get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we’re taking on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down so you can sleep better at night.\n\nYou know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on Earth.\n\nFor example, one in ten Americans has diabetes.\n\nEvery day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive. Insulin has been around for 100 years. It costs drug companies just $10 a vial to make.\n\nBut, Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nWe capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare.\n\nBut there are millions of other Americans who are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives.\n\nLet’s finish the job this time.\n\nLet’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it.\n\nThis law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year when there are in fact many drugs, like expensive cancer drugs, that can cost up to $10,000, $12,000, and $14,000 a year.\n\nIf drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies will have to pay Medicare back the difference.\n\nAnd we’re finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down prescription drug costs doesn’t just save seniors money.\n\nIt will cut the federal deficit, saving tax payers hundreds of billions of dollars on the prescription drugs the government buys for Medicare.\n\nWhy wouldn’t we want to do that?\n\nNow, some members here are threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nMake no mistake, if you try to do anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it.\n\nI’m pleased to say that more Americans have health insurance now than ever in history.\n\nA record 16 million people are enrolled under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThanks to the law I signed last year, millions are saving $800 a year on their premiums.\n\nBut the way that law was written, that benefit expires after 2025.\n\nLet’s finish the job, make those savings permanent, and expand coverage to those left off Medicaid.\n\nLook, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever to tackle the climate crisis.\n\nLowering utility bills, creating American jobs, and leading the world to a clean energy future.\n\nI’ve visited the devastating aftermaths of record floods and droughts, storms and wildfires.\n\nIn addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho, we are rebuilding for the long term.\n\nNew electric grids able to weather the next major storm.\n\nRoads and water systems to withstand the next big flood.\n\nClean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities too often left behind.\n\nWe’re building 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations installed across the country by tens of thousands of IBEW workers.\n\nAnd helping families save more than $1,000 a year with tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances.\n\nHistoric conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our lands.\n\nLet’s face reality.\n\nThe climate crisis doesn’t care if your state is red or blue. It is an existential threat.\n\nWe have an obligation to our children and grandchildren to confront it. I’m proud of how America is at last stepping up to the challenge.\n\nBut there’s so much more to do.\n\nWe will finish the job.\n\nAnd we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share.\n\nI’m a capitalist. But just pay your fair share.\n\nAnd I think a lot of you at home agree with me that our present tax system is simply unfair.\n\nThe idea that in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxes?\n\nThat’s simply not fair.\n\nBut now, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15%.\n\nJust 15%.\n\nThat’s less than a nurse pays. Let me be clear.\n\nUnder my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in taxes.\n\nNobody. Not one penny.\n\nBut there’s more to do.\n\nLet’s finish the job. Reward work, not just wealth. Pass my proposal for a billionaire minimum tax.\n\nBecause no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.\n\nYou may have noticed that Big Oil just reported record profits.\n\nLast year, they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis.\n\nIt’s outrageous.\n\nThey invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production and keep gas prices down.\n\nInstead, they used those record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders.\n\nCorporations ought to do the right thing.\n\nThat’s why I propose that we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks to encourage long term investments instead.\n\nThey will still make a considerable profit.\n\nLet’s finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes.\n\nInstead of cutting the number of audits of wealthy tax payers, I signed a law that will reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats.\n\nThat’s being fiscally responsible.\n\nIn the last two years, my administration cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion – the largest deficit reduction in American history.\n\nUnder the previous administration, America’s deficit went up four years in a row.\n\nBecause of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor.\n\nNearly 25% of the entire national debt, a debt that took 200 years to accumulate, was added by that administration alone.\n\nHow did Congress respond to all that debt?\n\nThey lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis.\n\nThey paid America’s bills to prevent economic disaster for our country.\n\nTonight, I’m asking this Congress to follow suit.\n\nLet us commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never, ever be questioned.\n\nSome of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what their plans are.\n\nInstead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years.\n\nThat means if Congress doesn’t vote to keep them, those programs will go away.\n\nOther Republicans say if we don’t cut Social Security and Medicare, they’ll let America default on its debt for the first time in our history.\n\nI won’t let that happen.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare are a lifeline for millions of seniors.\n\nAmericans have been paying into them with every single paycheck since they started working.\n\nSo tonight, let’s all agree to stand up for seniors. Stand up and show them we will not cut Social Security. We will not cut Medicare.\n\nThose benefits belong to the American people. They earned them.\n\nIf anyone tries to cut Social Security, I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.\n\nI will not allow them to be taken away.\n\nNot today. Not tomorrow. Not ever.\n\nNext month when I offer my fiscal plan, I ask my Republican friends to offer their plan.\n\nWe can sit down together and discuss both plans together.\n\nMy plan will lower the deficit by $2 trillion.\n\nI won’t cut a single Social Security or Medicare benefit.\n\nIn fact, I will extend the Medicare Trust Fund by at least two decades.\n\nI will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. And I will pay for the ideas I’ve talked about tonight by making the wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share.\n\nLook, here’s the deal. Big corporations aren’t just taking advantage of the tax code. They’re taking advantage of you, the American consumer.\n\nHere’s my message to all of you out there: I have your back. We’re already preventing insurance companies from sending surprise medical bills, stopping 1 million surprise bills a month.\n\nWe’re protecting seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.\n\nMillions of Americans can now save thousands of dollars because they can finally get hearing aids over-the-counter without a prescription.\n\nCapitalism without competition is not capitalism. It is exploitation.\n\nLast year I cracked down on foreign shipping companies that were making you pay higher prices for everyday goods coming into our country.\n\nI signed a bipartisan bill that cut shipping costs by 90%, helping American farmers, businesses, and consumers.\n\nLet’s finish the job.\n\nPass bipartisan legislation to strengthen antitrust enforcement and prevent big online platforms from giving their own products an unfair advantage.\n\nMy administration is also taking on “junk” fees, those hidden surcharges too many businesses use to make you pay more.\n\nFor example, we’re making airlines show you the full ticket price upfront and refund your money if your flight is cancelled or delayed.\n\nWe’ve reduced exorbitant bank overdraft fees, saving consumers more than $1 billion a year.\n\nWe’re cutting credit card late fees by 75%, from $30 to $8.\n\nJunk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most folks in homes like the one I grew up in. They add up to hundreds of dollars a month.\n\nThey make it harder for you to pay the bills or afford that family trip.\n\nI know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with it.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nWe’ve written a bill to stop all that. It’s called the Junk Fee Prevention Act.\n\nWe’ll ban surprise “resort fees” that hotels tack on to your bill. These fees can cost you up to $90 a night at hotels that aren’t even resorts.\n\nWe’ll make cable internet and cellphone companies stop charging you up to $200 or more when you decide to switch to another provider.\n\nWe’ll cap service fees on tickets to concerts and sporting events and make companies disclose all fees upfront.\n\nAnd we’ll prohibit airlines from charging up to $50 roundtrip for families just to sit together.\n\nBaggage fees are bad enough – they can’t just treat your child like a piece of luggage.\n\nAmericans are tired of being played for suckers.\n\nPass the Junk Fee Prevention Act so companies stop ripping us off.\n\nFor too long, workers have been getting stiffed.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nWe’re beginning to restore the dignity of work.\n\nFor example, 30 million workers had to sign non-compete agreements when they took a job. So a cashier at a burger place can’t cross the street to take the same job at another burger place to make a couple bucks more.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nWe’re banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers and pay them what they’re worth.\n\nI’m so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing.\n\nPass the PRO Act because workers have a right to form a union. And let’s guarantee all workers a living wage.\n\nLet’s also make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick days, paid family and medical leave, and affordable child care that will enable millions more people to go to work.\n\nLet’s also restore the full Child Tax Credit, which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.\n\nAnd by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity. We increase economic growth.\n\nLet’s also finish the job and get more families access to affordable and quality housing.\n\nLet’s get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so. And give a little more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved ones.\n\nPass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the home care services they need and support the workers who are doing God’s work.\n\nThese plans are fully paid for and we can afford to do them.\n\nRestoring the dignity of work also means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class.\n\nWhen we made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world.\n\nBut the world has caught up.\n\nJill, who teaches full-time, has an expression: “Any nation that out-educates us will out-compete us.”\n\nFolks, you all know 12 years is not enough to win the economic competition for the 21st Century.\n\nIf you want America to have the best-educated workforce, let’s finish the job by providing access to pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds.\n\nStudies show that children who go to pre-school are nearly 50% more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree, no matter their background.\n\nLet’s give public school teachers a raise.\n\nAnd we’re making progress by reducing student debt and increasing Pell Grants for working- and middle-class families.\n\nLet’s finish the job, connect students to career opportunities starting in high school and provide two years of community college, some of the best career training in America, in addition to being a pathway to a four-year degree.\n\nLet’s offer every American the path to a good career whether they go to college or not.\n\nAnd folks, in the midst of the COVID crisis when schools were closed, let’s also recognize how far we’ve come in the fight against the pandemic itself.\n\nWhile the virus is not gone, thanks to the resilience of the American people, we have broken COVID’s grip on us.\n\nCOVID deaths are down nearly 90%.\n\nWe’ve saved millions of lives and opened our country back up.\n\nAnd soon we’ll end the public health emergency.\n\nBut we will remember the toll and pain that will never go away for so many. More than 1 million Americans have lost their lives to COVID.\n\nFamilies grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table.\n\nWe remember them, and we remain vigilant.\n\nWe still need to monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments.\n\nSo Congress needs to fund these efforts and keep America safe.\n\nAnd as we emerge from this crisis stronger, I’m also doubling down on prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses afloat during the pandemic.\n\nBefore I came to office many inspector generals who protect taxpayer dollars were sidelined. Fraud was rampant.\n\nLast year, I told you the watchdogs are back. Since then, we’ve recovered billions of taxpayer dollars.\n\nNow, let’s triple our anti-fraud strike forces going after these criminals, double the statute of limitations on these crimes, and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars from the American people.\n\nFor every dollar we put into fighting fraud, taxpayers get back at least ten times as much.\n\nCOVID left other scars, like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.\n\nWe have an obligation to make sure all our people are safe.\n\nPublic safety depends on public trust. But too often that trust is violated.\n\nJoining us tonight are the parents of Tyre Nichols, who had to bury him just last week. There are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief of losing a child.\n\nBut imagine what it’s like to lose a child at the hands of the law.\n\nImagine having to worry whether your son or daughter will come home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving their car.\n\nI’ve never had to have the talk with my children – Beau, Hunter, and Ashley – that so many Black and Brown families have had with their children.\n\nIf a police officer pulls you over, turn on your interior lights. Don’t reach for your license. Keep your hands on the steering wheel.\n\nImagine having to worry like that every day in America.\n\nHere’s what Tyre’s mom shared with me when I asked her how she finds the courage to carry on and speak out.\n\nWith faith in God, she said her son “was a beautiful soul and something good will come from this.”\n\nImagine how much courage and character that takes.\n\nIt’s up to us. It’s up to all of us.\n\nWe all want the same thing.\n\nNeighborhoods free of violence.\n\nLaw enforcement who earn the community’s trust.\n\nOur children to come home safely.\n\nEqual protection under the law; that’s the covenant we have with each other in America.\n\nAnd we know police officers put their lives on the line every day, and we ask them to do too much.\n\nTo be counselors, social workers, psychologists; responding to drug overdoses, mental health crises, and more.\n\nWe ask too much of them.\n\nI know most cops are good, decent people. They risk their lives every time they put on that shield.\n\nBut what happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often.\n\nWe have to do better.\n\nGive law enforcement the training they need, hold them to higher standards, and help them succeed in keeping everyone safe.\n\nWe also need more first responders and other professionals to address growing mental health and substance abuse challenges.\n\nMore resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime; more community intervention programs; more investments in housing, education, and job training.\n\nAll this can help prevent violence in the first place.\n\nAnd when police officers or departments violate the public’s trust, we must hold them accountable.\n\nWith the support of families of victims, civil rights groups, and law enforcement, I signed an executive order for all federal officers banning chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and other key elements of the George Floyd Act.\n\nLet’s commit ourselves to make the words of Tyre’s mother come true, something good must come from this.\n\nAll of us in this chamber, we need to rise to this moment.\n\nWe can’t turn away.\n\nLet’s do what we know in our hearts we need to do.\n\nLet’s come together and finish the job on police reform.\n\nDo something.\n\nThat was the same plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde: Do something on gun violence.\n\nThank God we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades.\n\nThat includes things that the majority of responsible gun owners support, like enhanced background checks for 18 to 21-year-olds and red flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others.\n\nBut we know our work is not done.\n\nJoining us tonight is Brandon Tsay, a 26-year-old hero.\n\nBrandon put off his college dreams to stay by his mom’s side as she was dying from cancer. He now works at a dance studio started by his grandparents.\n\nTwo weeks ago, during Lunar New Year celebrations, he heard the studio’s front door close and saw a man pointing a gun at him.\n\nHe thought he was going to die, but then he thought about the people inside.\n\nIn that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semi-automatic pistol away from a gunman who had already killed 11 people at another dance studio.\n\nHe saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well.\n\nBan assault weapons once and for all.\n\nWe did it before. I led the fight to ban them in 1994.\n\nIn the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled.\n\nLet’s finish the job and ban assault weapons again.\n\nAnd let’s also come together on immigration and make it a bipartisan issue like it was before.\n\nWe now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers and seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.\n\nSince we launched our new border plan last month, unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97%.\n\nBut America’s border problems won’t be fixed until Congress acts.\n\nIf you won’t pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border. And a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.\n\nHere in the people’s House, it’s our duty to protect all the people’s rights and freedoms.\n\nCongress must restore the right the Supreme Court took away last year and codify Roe v. Wade to protect every woman’s constitutional right to choose.\n\nThe Vice President and I are doing everything we can to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient privacy. But already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans.\n\nMake no mistake; if Congress passes a national abortion ban, I will veto it.\n\nLet’s also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity.\n\nOur strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our example. Let’s remember the world is watching.\n\nI spoke from this chamber one year ago, just days after Vladimir Putin unleashed his brutal war against Ukraine.\n\nA murderous assault, evoking images of the death and destruction Europe suffered in World War II.\n\nPutin’s invasion has been a test for the ages. A test for America. A test for the world.\n\nWould we stand for the most basic of principles?\n\nWould we stand for sovereignty?\n\nWould we stand for the right of people to live free from tyranny?\n\nWould we stand for the defense of democracy?\n\nFor such a defense matters to us because it keeps the peace and prevents open season for would-be aggressors to threaten our security and prosperity. One year later, we know the answer.\n\nYes, we would.\n\nAnd yes, we did.\n\nTogether, we did what America always does at our best.\n\nWe led.\n\nWe united NATO and built a global coalition.\n\nWe stood against Putin’s aggression.\n\nWe stood with the Ukrainian people.\n\nTonight, we are once again joined by Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States. She represents not just her nation, but the courage of her people.\n\nAmbassador, America is united in our support for your country. We will stand with you as long as it takes.\n\nOur nation is working for more freedom, more dignity, and more peace,\n\nnot just in Europe, but everywhere.\n\nBefore I came to office, the story was about how the People’s Republic of China was increasing its power and America was falling in the world.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nI’ve made clear with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict.\n\nI will make no apologies that we are investing to make America strong. Investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future, and that China’s government is intent on dominating.\n\nInvesting in our alliances and working with our allies to protect our advanced technologies so they’re not used against us.\n\nModernizing our military to safeguard stability and deter aggression.\n\nToday, we’re in the strongest position in decades to compete with China or anyone else in the world.\n\nI am committed to work with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the world.\n\nBut make no mistake: as we made clear last week, if China’s threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.\n\nAnd let’s be clear: winning the competition with China should unite all of us. We face serious challenges across the world.\n\nBut in the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker.\n\nAutocracies have grown weaker, not stronger.\n\nAmerica is rallying the world again to meet those challenges, from climate and global health, to food insecurity, to terrorism and territorial aggression.\n\nAllies are stepping up, spending more and doing more.\n\nAnd bridges are forming between partners in the Pacific and those in the Atlantic. And those who bet against America are learning just how wrong they are.\n\nIt’s never a good bet to bet against America.\n\nWhen I came to office, most everyone assumed bipartisanship was impossible. But I never believed it.\n\nThat’s why a year ago, I offered a Unity Agenda for the nation.\n\nWe’ve made real progress.\n\nTogether, we passed a law making it easier for doctors to prescribe effective treatments for opioid addiction.\n\nPassed a gun safety law making historic investments in mental health.\n\nLaunched ARPA-H to drive breakthroughs in the fight against cancer,\n\nAlzheimer’s, diabetes, and so much more.\n\nWe passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act, named for the late Iraq war veteran whose story about exposure to toxic burn pits I shared here last year.\n\nBut there is so much more to do. And we can do it together.\n\nJoining us tonight is a father named Doug from Newton, New Hampshire.\n\nHe wrote Jill and me a letter about his daughter Courtney. Contagious laugh. Her sister’s best friend.\n\nHe shared a story all too familiar to millions of Americans.\n\nCourtney discovered pills in high school. It spiraled into addiction and eventually her death from a fentanyl overdose.\n\nShe was 20 years old.\n\nDescribing the last eight years without her, Doug said, “There is no worse pain.”\n\nYet their family has turned pain into purpose, working to end stigma and change laws.\n\nHe told us he wants to “start the journey towards America’s recovery.”\n\nDoug, we’re with you.\n\nFentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.\n\nLet’s launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production, sale, and trafficking, with more drug detection machines to inspect cargo and stop pills and powder at the border.\n\nWorking with couriers like Fed Ex to inspect more packages for drugs. Strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking.\n\nSecond, let’s do more on mental health, especially for our children. When millions of young people are struggling with bullying, violence, trauma, we owe them greater access to mental health care at school.\n\nWe must finally hold social media companies accountable for the experiment they are running on our children for profit.\n\nAnd it’s time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of us.\n\nThird, let’s do more to keep our nation’s one truly sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when they come home.\n\nJob training and job placement for veterans and their spouses as they return to civilian life.\n\nHelping veterans afford their rent because no one should be homeless in this country, especially not those who served it.\n\nAnd we cannot go on losing 17 veterans a day to the silent scourge of suicide.\n\nThe VA is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screenings and a proven program that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they’re going through and get the help they need.\n\nAnd fourth, last year Jill and I re-ignited the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead in our Administration.\n\nOur goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years. Turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases. And provide more support for patients and families.\n\nIt’s personal for so many of us.\n\nJoining us are Maurice and Kandice, an Irishman and a daughter of immigrants from Panama.\n\nThey met and fell in love in New York City and got married in the same chapel as Jill and I did.\n\nKindred spirits.\n\nHe wrote us a letter about their little daughter Ava.\n\nShe was just a year old when she was diagnosed with a rare kidney cancer.\n\n26 blood transfusions. 11 rounds of radiation. 8 rounds of chemo. 1 kidney removed.\n\nA 5% survival rate.\n\nHe wrote how in the darkest moments he thought, “if she goes, I can’t stay.”\n\nJill and I understand, like so many of you.\n\nThey read how Jill described our family’s cancer journey and how we tried to steal moments of joy where you can.\n\nFor them, that glimmer of joy was a half-smile from their baby girl. It meant everything.\n\nThey never gave up hope.\n\nAva never gave up hope. She turns four next month.\n\nThey just found out that Ava beat the odds and is on her way to being cancer free, and she’s watching from the White House tonight.\n\nFor the lives we can save and for the lives we have lost, let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and proves that we can do big things.\n\nTwenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions, we undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS. It’s been a huge success.\n\nI believe we can do the same with cancer.\n\nLet’s end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all.\n\nThere’s one reason why we’re able to do all of these things: our democracy itself.\n\nIt’s the most fundamental thing of all.\n\nWith democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is.\n\nFor the last few years our democracy has been threatened, attacked, and put at risk.\n\nPut to the test here, in this very room, on January 6th.\n\nAnd then, just a few months ago, unhinged by the Big Lie, an assailant unleashed political violence in the home of the then-Speaker of this House of Representatives. Using the very same language that insurrectionists who stalked these halls chanted on January 6th.\n\nHere tonight in this chamber is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack, but is as tough and strong and as resilient as they get.\n\nMy friend, Paul Pelosi.\n\nBut such a heinous act never should have happened.\n\nWe must all speak out. There is no place for political violence in America. In America, we must protect the right to vote, not suppress that fundamental right. We honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the people. We must uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy.\n\nAnd we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor.\n\nDemocracy must not be a partisan issue. It must be an American issue.\n\nEvery generation of Americans has faced a moment where they have been called on to protect our democracy, to defend it, to stand up for it.\n\nAnd this is our moment.\n\nMy fellow Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point. One of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the decisions we make now will decide the course of this nation and of the world for decades to come.\n\nWe are not bystanders to history. We are not powerless before the forces that confront us. It is within our power, of We the People. We are facing the test of our time and the time for choosing is at hand.\n\nWe must be the nation we have always been at our best. Optimistic. Hopeful. Forward-looking.\n\nA nation that embraces, light over darkness, hope over fear, unity over division. Stability over chaos.\n\nWe must see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. We are a good people, the only nation in the world built on an idea.\n\nThat all of us, every one of us, is created equal in the image of God. A nation that stands as a beacon to the world. A nation in a new age of possibilities.\n\nSo I have come here to fulfil my constitutional duty to report on the state of the union. And here is my report.\n\nBecause the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong.\n\nAs I stand here tonight, I have never been more optimistic about the future of America. We just have to remember who we are.\n\nWe are the United States of America and there is nothing, nothing\n\nbeyond our capacity if we do it together.\n\nMay God bless you all. May God protect our troops.\n\n###", "authors": ["The White House"], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-rise-of-political-violence-in-the-united-states/", "title": "The Rise of Political Violence in the United States | Journal of ..."}, {"url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/07/uvalde-matthew-mcconaughey-guns-white-house/", "title": "Uvalde native Matthew McConaughey visits White House to push for ...", "text": "Texans need truth.

Some scholars claim that Americans are so polarized they are on the brink of civil war. Other polls suggest that voters agree on plenty of policies and that polarization is an illusion. Some philanthropists call for pluralism and civility, while others lean into activism, believing polarization is a byproduct of change toward a more just world. So, is the United States polarized or not? If it is, what is causing the polarization and what are its consequences? Should polarization be solved or tolerated?\n\nThis paper is intended to answer these questions. It opens with five facts about polarization in the United States today and what those imply for possible interventions. A literature review follows, organized chronologically to explain the scholarly shift from thinking of polarization as an ideological, policy-based phenomenon to an issue of emotion, as well as the emerging understanding of polarization as both a social phenomenon and a political strategy.

Americans across parties share many policy preferences. There is some overlap even on hot-button issues, such as abortion and guns, and more overlap on how to teach American history.1 It is important not to make too much of this overlap, however. For instance, a majority of Democrats as well as four in ten Republicans support banning high-capacity ammunition magazines and creating a federal database to track gun sales; nearly as many Republicans support banning assault-style weapons. But only 18 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaners feel gun violence is a major problem (versus 73 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaners). So despite the significant policy overlap, only one side is motivated to put the issue on the agenda.2 Democrats have moved to the left on racial issues and some social issues over the last decade, and Republicans have moved to the right on immigration under Joe Biden’s administration, though there remains overlap on these issues as well.3 In some cases, Republicans appear to be slowly adopting more progressive views on some social issues, resulting in what looks like polarization but is perhaps better characterized as faster moves by the left.4 However, most partisans hold major misbeliefs about the other party’s preferences that lead them to think there is far less shared policy belief. This perception gap is highest among progressive activists, followed closely by extreme conservatives: in other words, the people who are most involved in civic and political life hold the least accurate views of the other side’s beliefs. Figure 1 shows the gap between what groups of Americans think the other side believes and what they self-report believing, as of 2019. American politicians are highly ideologically polarized. In other words, they believe in and vote for different sets of policies, with little overlap. This trend has grown in a steady, unpunctuated manner for decades.5 One reason that the most highly politically engaged Americans may misunderstand the other side is that they correctly estimate the extreme ideological polarization among politicians. It is easy to assume that polarized voters are selecting more polarized leaders—and that theory may hold true for recent primary elections. However, that is not the main story. The process begins long before voters get a choice: more ideologically extreme politicians have been running for office since the 1980s.6 Among the pool of people wishing to run, party chairs more often select and support extreme candidates, especially on the right. (In 2013, Republican party chairs at the county level selected ten extreme candidates for every one moderate; the ratio was two to one for Democrats.) The increase in “safe” seats, in which one party is overwhelmingly likely to win, explains candidate and party preferences for more polarizing platforms, but it does not explain the depth of the Republican preference.7 Parties and candidates clearly believe that more polarizing candidates are more likely to win elections. This may be a self-fulfilling prophecy: voters exposed to more polarizing rhetoric from leaders who share their partisan identity are likely to alter their preferences based on their understanding of what their group believes and has normalized—particularly among primary voters whose identity is more tied to their party. 8 However, only about 20 percent of each party votes in primaries, and 41 percent of Americans are independents who may not have strong party identity and are barred from voting in some states’ primaries.9 That leaves the majority of voters with a relatively low ability to pick a less polarizing candidate of their party. Philanthropists and prodemocracy organizations attempting to reduce polarization often assume that the problem they must grapple with is polarized voters, but their interventions should also take into account the fact that that some of the ideological extremism and polarization since the 1980s is candidate- and party-driven. While at this point, candidates and parties may be responding to polarized primary voters, candidates and parties have been driving the polarization, and not all voters are ideologically polarized. The disparity between where leaders are ideologically and where their voters are precludes legislative policy agreement on many issues. Average voters are not able to assert their (often weak) policy preferences because they do not have an effective way to vote out representatives who do not accurately represent their constituents’ views, particularly on the right where party chairs are likely to substitute one extreme candidate for another. Even though Americans are not as ideologically polarized as they believe themselves to be, they are emotionally polarized (known as “affective polarization”). In other words, they do not like members of the other party. Americans harbor strong dislike for members of the other party (though they also dislike their own parties, as well).10 While social media is often blamed for this phenomenon, affective polarization started growing before the internet: its onset more closely correlates with the rise of cable news and radio talk shows.11 It is also growing most swiftly among Americans over sixty-five years old, a demographic that uses the internet less, but watches television and listens to talk radio far more, than younger age groups who are less polarized.12 These findings and other studies about the effects of social media suggest that all media, not just social media, may be playing a role. Many studies have considered what could reduce these feelings of dislike for the other party. They have found that affective polarization appears to be driven largely by an individual’s misbeliefs about the policy beliefs of the other party, a sense that members of the other party dislike members of their party, a fear that the other party supports breaking democratic norms, and misunderstandings about the demographic composition of the other party (for example, believing that Republicans are old, wealthy, evangelical Christians, while Democrats are young, unionized minorities, when the median demographic characteristics of both parties are actually quite similar).13 Correcting these misperceptions can help reduce affective polarization. Studies have found that telling people in a believable way that they share policy beliefs and similar demographics and creating a sense that there is a shared identity (though the latter is complicated for minorities who prefer dual identities) are interventions that can reduce affective polarization.14 Often, bringing people together across difference is used to accomplish these ends, and this contact between groups may reduce affective polarization.15 There is a problem with engaging in such interventions to improve U.S. democracy, however. While affective polarization is growing quickly in the United States, it is actually not much higher there than in many European countries. In other words, many European countries show affective polarization at about the same level as that of the United States, but their democracies are not suffering as much, suggesting that something about the U.S. political system, media, campaigns, or social fabric is allowing Americans’ level of emotional polarization to be particularly harmful to U.S. democracy.16 Affective polarization is unlikely to be causing democratic backsliding or political violence on its own. The problem is not polarized emotions alone but how those feelings interact with voting systems, candidate incentives, and personal relationships. A series of studies found that it was possible to reduce affective polarization in lab tests, though these effects were only tested after short periods. (The most successful intervention managed to reduce animosity to its 1980s level, but the effects crumbled after a week.)17 But even successful lab interventions had no effect on attitudes toward political violence and other antidemocratic behaviors. For example, experiments that reduced affective polarization among participants found no marked changes in respondents’ willingness to support their party if a candidate employed antidemocratic means to suppress the vote, redraw districts “even if it may be technically illegal,” suppress a protest by the other side, or engage in corruption.18 Reducing affective polarization also did not affect survey respondents’ loyalty to their members of Congress (who may have engaged in some of these behaviors) or increase their desire for bipartisanship. In other words, affective polarization levels describe how people feel interpersonally about the other party’s members. But those feelings do not directly influence how they may behave—they may feel more warmly toward another party but are still likely to vote the same way, support the same policy positions, and have the same levels of disrespect for democratic norms, among other behaviors. These studies are confounding: how can emotions change without people altering their attitudes or actions? It is more understandable if one considers a typical effort to reduce affective polarization, such as bringing a group of Democrats together with Republicans over a dinner, or a series of dinners, full of richly moderated discussions and interpersonal insights. That experience may lead the individuals involved to understand each other better and feel more warmly toward the entire groups each side represents. But even if their emotions have shifted by 20 percent—a huge effect—their voting cannot alter by 20 percent because there are only two parties to choose from. So for feelings to affect votes in a two-party system, the dinner guests must engage in a major shift of identity. Alternatively, they may feel more warmly toward the other party but vote as they did before, leaving them with some cognitive dissonance. Most are likely to take the latter path and resolve the dissonance by reducing their warm feelings over time. Similarly, after the dinner has deepened understanding and positive feelings, most people will return to their existing religious congregations, friendships, workplaces, and other institutional affiliations. If they have really had a deep moment of change, they may speak up in these settings for their newfound appreciation. But if they meet resistance after sharing their new emotions, they are likely to retreat back into polarization over time. The lab experiments (and findings from real-world examples such as decades of attempts to improve relationships between Israelis and Palestinians) suggest that short-term work to change individual feelings will decay over time in the face of these broader pressures unless immense care is taken to build deep, long-term friendships or create another set of relationships or institutions for people to spend time in that will allow them to act on their altered feelings.19 In other words, it is not that affective polarization is unimportant: antidemocratic behavior is unlikely to change unless underlying emotions among the voting public change. But it is as if emotions are on a hypothetical dial that can be shifted by degrees, while most behavior is on a dial that has only a few preset settings. For emotional change to yield lasting impacts, people must have more behavioral options—groups of differently minded friends to shift to (which is particularly hard in sparsely populated rural areas), a broader set of political choices, and other options in their social and political spaces. Similarly, affective polarization is not causing political violence directly. It is probably contributing to an environment that allows politicians and opinion leaders to increase violence targeted at politicians, election officials, women, and many types of minorities. Affective polarization in the United States has been rising for decades, while political violence only increased sharply in 2016.20 Affective polarization is also quite symmetrical across parties, while political violence is overwhelmingly from the right.21 This suggests that emotional feelings of hatred toward members of the other party are not a primary cause of political violence. In fact, some scholars have found that affective polarization is not even correlated with political violence or justifications of such violence (though other surveys have found correlation between “strong Republicans” or “Make America Great Again (MAGA) Republicans” and support for violence, while the same does not hold true for “strong Democrats”).22 It certainly feels as if the vitriol and violence-mongering in U.S. politics has something to do with the recent increase in political violence. How can this discrepancy be explained? People who commit political violence have aggressive personalities.23 Many who commit forms of political violence that do not include preplanning—such as most hate crimes, threats, and violence at rallies—also have poor self-control or have lowered their self-control temporarily (by drinking, for instance).24 These traits are shared across individuals who commit all forms of violence. What is unique about political violence is that it does not arise from interpersonal friction. Instead, for people with low self-control (a large pool that includes, for instance, teenage boys and anyone who has drunk in excess) and aggressive personalities (which limits that pool somewhat) to turn to violence, they need to be enraged and have that anger directed at a group of people they don’t know. They also need to believe that they will not face severe consequences or not care about consequences (because they are too impulsive to care or because they think the consequences are worth it). In moments of low political polarization, aggressive people whose impulse control is low are likely to focus most of their rage on personal interactions: domestic violence, road rage, violent crime, or even a school or workplace shooting. Some may commit hate crimes if they are prejudiced and come across a member of a minority group. Those experiencing psychosis or using particular drugs that create illusions of grandeur may direct anger toward political figures, but they are more likely to focus that desire for a sense of importance on a nearer target, such as their school or workplace. Only an insignificant number will act; most pose greater harm to themselves. In other words, in a low-polarization environment, aggressive, impulsive individuals who don’t fear consequences may commit violence, but the targets will largely be apolitical. Meanwhile, violence is likely to be lower because people are facing only self-generated rage, not an additional level of anger and grievance projected toward people outside their personal interactions. However, as partisan leaders and media personalities demonize the other party, they can create feelings of rage among followers who fear the consequences of the other party’s perceived actions. Dehumanizing and denigrating rhetoric that normalizes violence or threats against some groups turns that sense of fear and anger into a target by making certain groups appear to be both threatening and, at the same time, vulnerable.25 Finally, the normalization of violence by political leaders, in particular, may provide a sense that acting violently against those groups will be permitted, may not be punished, or could be lauded and turn one into a hero (such as how Kyle Rittenhouse was supported monetarily and publicly embraced after he traveled to Wisconsin to offer “protection” from a Black Lives Matter protest and shot and killed two people).26 Thus, the individuals committing political violence may not be very polarized themselves; they may even be fairly apolitical. But in seeking to connect to and belong within a political community, they may find leaders who make violence seem normal or even laudable, build followers’ rage, and suggest a target for that anger in a political figure, government official, or minority scapegoat. Affective polarization within society gives them a way to cloak violent impulses in a greater cause that may even allow them to imagine themselves socially embraced or heroized (a potent draw for individuals who may feel ostracized because of their irritable, aggrieved personalities). And hints that political leaders accept such violence reduces concerns about the consequences of their violence, which might otherwise stop them from taking part in a rally or other event where their aggression could manifest. As political leaders gin up anger and reduce the sense of consequences, and as affective polarization creates a sense of community and belonging for aggressive, more authoritarian personalities, all types of targeted violence are increasing. Not only are American politicians (from school board members to representatives in Congress) receiving more threats, but also, threats against judges are up, hate crimes are at the highest recorded point in the twenty-first century, and mass shootings are spiking, with perpetrators adopting some political rhetoric into their manifestos or targeting scapegoated groups.27 Conversely, if Americans had very high levels of affective polarization, but politicians, media leaders, and local leaders maintained a stance of equanimity and civility toward the other party, political violence would probably not increase much outside of particularly virulent subcommunities. This is what occurred in the 1980s when violence rose within the neo-Nazi skinhead movement and in the 1990s when violence grew within the militia movement; both movements were viewed as unacceptable by the vast majority of partisan leaders so violence did not spill into wider society. Affective polarization probably requires alterations to leader rhetoric, norms of violence acceptability within a community, and the perceived likelihood of punishment to increase violence across American society. These other variables may be amenable to faster alteration than levels of affective polarization across a society. Understanding the key role of political and opinion leaders in manipulating affective polarization has led to a newer way of looking at polarization that is just starting to spread to U.S. democracy experts but is more prevalent among scholars who compare different political systems and scholars who study civil wars. They consider the structure of politics, looking at whether a variety of identities have collapsed into just two opposing groups that see each other as threatening and even immoral. And they look at whether such polarization can be instrumentalized by politicians as a winning political strategy. Jennifer McCoy, who has pioneered looking at the ways in which emotions and political strategies intersect, finds that the United States has been more “perniciously polarized” for longer than any consolidated democracy has ever been.28\n\nWhat This Understanding Means for Interventions\n\nThese findings suggest that efforts to tackle polarization must be carefully calibrated to have an effect on what is usually described as their ultimate goal: a resilient democracy with strengthened guardrails and less political violence.\n\nPluralism programs to bridge differences are not enough to improve democracy. Instead, interventions to change individuals’ emotions must be paired with efforts that alter how politicians are incentivized to instrumentalize or amplify affective polarization as a strategy. Programs focused solely on engaging individuals from different groups to talk about their differences are based on intergroup contact theory. That literature suggests that these programs can, if well structured, successfully change the feelings of the people who participate (though they can create backlash and harden prejudice if poorly structured).29 However, just as affective polarization can be reduced in lab settings without impacting views and behaviors regarding democracy and political violence, talking across difference can reduce individual affective polarization—but there is no evidence that it impacts those individuals’ antidemocratic behaviors, preferences for antidemocratic candidates, or support for political violence. Nor is there any evidence that changing feelings on an individual level will aggregate into democratic improvements. A literature review of peacebuilding programs in other countries concluded that “programming that focuses on change at the Individual/Personal level, but that never links or translates into action at the Socio-Political level has no discernible effect on peace.”30 Lab research suggests that similar results will hold in the United States. As Mina Cikara, a psychology professor at Harvard University, has explained, “we frequently see equivalent degrees of out-party dislike on both sides, but there’s only one party seeking to curb voting access and throw out election results.”31 Efforts to talk across divides and reduce emotional dislike can improve understanding and reduce prejudice, but these interventions will not result in social or political improvements unless the trusting relationships that are created eventually lead to collaboration that alters broader social norms or political incentives.32 Interventions should aim to reduce feelings of threat, not just feelings of dislike. The most effective interventions for reducing both affective polarization and antidemocratic attitudes involve reducing fears that the other side is intent on breaking democratic norms. A number of studies have found that partisans overestimate the willingness of the other side to break democratic norms and that overestimation makes them more likely to support or even take antidemocratic practices for their side.33 The same holds for political violence.34 The only interventions that currently appear to have a valuable effect on antidemocratic attitudes as well as affective polarization focus on correcting the particular misbeliefs about the other side’s willingness to break democratic norms.35 For instance, lab experiments in which participants watched a video of Utah’s gubernatorial candidates discussing how each would honor the results of the 2020 election reduced participants’ support for their own side taking antidemocratic action. Correcting misperceptions by simply presenting the data reduces support for antidemocratic action, but only marginally because people may find the data unbelievable. When best practices are used to increase believability—such as showing people talking—they can significantly reduce support for antidemocratic action, but the effects do not seem to last for long, given the onslaught of contrary news in real-life contexts.36 Nevertheless, it is worth focusing less on the emotions of dislike that Americans may have for one another and focusing more on perceptions of threat—particularly specific fears that the other party will undermine democracy to gain power. Quelling these fears could reduce the arms race. Unfortunately, much prodemocracy programming enhances fear that the other side poses an existential threat to democracy. The attempt to use fear to get voters to pay attention to serious threats to democracy is understandable, particularly raising alarms in certain states or about certain politicians given the degree to which the Republican Party is being taken over by an antidemocratic faction. However, the broad sweep of fear may encourage people to vote while also building support for antidemocratic behavior. This is a real problem the prodemocracy community must consider seriously, possibly by experimenting with more positive, aspirational mobilizing strategies rather than relying on threats. The effects on younger voters, who are already less attached to the democratic system than other demographics, may be particularly harmful over time.37 At the same time, misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation regarding Democratic election malfeasance are creating the same real sense of threat and desire for undemocratic action to save democracy on the Republican side. This arms race is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is the core issue of the affective polarization problem. But as the most recent understanding of polarization suggests, changing feelings alone is not enough. Altering the sense of threat also requires changing political incentives that allow politicians to use hatred, othering, and claims that the other side is immoral as a winning political strategy. Win-lose-style, adversarial advocacy on the right-left dimension might be dangerous. Based on the finding above, advocacy that amplifies the belief that members of the other party are bent on destroying democracy itself is likely to deepen polarization and support for antidemocratic action on one’s own side. (So might a similar style of advocacy on issues adjacent to democracy, such as reproductive rights on the left or gun rights on the right, that campaigns by hardening beliefs that the other side is going to do away with democracy to solidify their control over the policy). The more each side fears the other is going to subvert the rules of the game, the more willing voters seem to be to do it first to lock in their party’s advantage. Meanwhile, highly partisan ideological advocacy may be subverting democracy indirectly. Highly adversarial advocacy in which partisans on one side of an issue are amassed, angered, and organized to change a policy along strict partisan lines is very likely to fail, given the intense ideological polarization of U.S. leaders and the overuse of the filibuster such that supermajorities are required for legislation to pass. Frequent failure to achieve reforms may be hardening misperceptions among voters about the average voter in the other party. Advocacy efforts that organize people toward such failed efforts can leave people more cynical. Meanwhile, levels of affective polarization are such that highly publicized, adversarial advocacy attempts are likely to generate backlash. Thus, this form of adversarial advocacy is likely to achieve few victories at the national level (though it may be able to achieve state-level change in reliably red or blue states). In either case, such success will generate backlash in other states or at the national level, creating Pyrrhic victories that are quickly overturned at the national level or are met with opposing legislation in other states. The United States may reach a point where the best it can hope for is to shore up democracy and inclusion in some states while abandoning others to a less democratic and inclusive future. This is, after all, what occurred under Jim Crow for eight decades. But America is not at this point yet, and an advocacy style that pushes the country closer to such a dystopic fate is in no way helpful to the goals of social justice. Instead, intense mobilization efforts built around a positive future vision are needed to galvanize voters without exacerbating antidemocratic attitudes. A different form of pluralistic work that coordinates groups to act on shared goals, despite other differences of opinion, may work to bridge partisanship, build trust, and advance a more just democracy. Even in today’s ideologically polarized Congress, progress has been made toward a more inclusive and stronger democracy using a strategy of coordinated action across difference. In 2022, with current levels of affective polarization, this type of programming led to success in reforming the Electoral Count Act, a crucial node for shoring up the U.S. democracy’s guardrails. It achieved the country’s only lasting, national modern criminal justice reform in 2018 and enshrined a national legal right to gay marriage in 2022. Advocacy framed to welcome Republicans as well as Democrats has allowed reproductive rights to gain ground in multiple states since the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade. Such programming has also been the bedrock of effective peacebuilding efforts in countries such as Colombia and Sierra Leone. Programming to bridge differences, not simply to talk but to find common ground among unlikely allies in order to act on shared problems, has another benefit: it may build trust and a sense of agency. A majority of the voting public are disgusted by politics in general, which they feel is corrupt and rigged against people like themselves.38 While they report feelings of affective polarization against the other party, 40 percent of Republicans also did not like their own political side until the MAGA movement.39 The affective polarization conversation misses the reality that a portion of angry, low-trust Americans do not simply dislike the other party but distrust nearly every institution in American life: big business, schools, newspapers, television news, Congress, the criminal justice system, and organized religion, among others.40 In reality, they are polarized from a political and economic system that feels separate (hence “elite”) and insensitive to their needs. While polling geared toward affective polarization has found them disgusted with the other party, they in fact feel frustrated and hopeless about the entire U.S. political and economic system in general. Instead of focusing on polarization, the alienation they feel needs to be addressed by enabling agency around problems they—and the people they are often pitted against in more simplistic media accounts—both want solved. These issues may be highly local, for instance, building a community’s resilience against more frequent extreme weather. Or they may entail major national mobilization, such as bringing together conservative religious groups and gay activists to pass the Respect for Marriage Act, which enshrined gay marriage as a national law just as it was under threat from Supreme Court rulings. Understanding which problems are shared and solvable cannot be guessed beforehand: it requires discussion and trust-building. Empirical evidence from overseas and from the United States has found that assembling groups across difference to talk can make a significant difference in a highly polarized atmosphere, if the goal is to uncover shared elements of a common agenda on which groups can act.41 In these cases, talking is not an end in itself but is used to build trust so that groups can work on concrete advocacy that moves countries toward less-polarized politics. Such advocacy can be highly adversarial, but against new lines of polarization rather than the right-left dimension (for example, uniting minority and White working-class Americans for better working conditions or bringing together rural White and minority Americans for recognition of rural needs as opposed to urban assumptions). Ironically, since misbeliefs about the other side’s policy preferences are strongest among highly educated, partisan political activists (and highest on the left), programs that attempt to solve problems by gaining understanding and working with unlikely allies on shared issues of concern may face the greatest pushback by those who claim to be most politically knowledgeable. This may obstruct the ability to build trust and agency among less politically engaged minority and White Americans whose preferences are quite different from those of engaged political elites. Polarization is a highly nuanced field, and small assumptions can lead to big mistakes. Practitioners and philanthropists should be particularly careful about assumptions regarding moderation. People who poll as moderates may also be antidemocratic or supportive of political violence, especially on the right. On the left, support for democracy may coincide with support for violence. Many people think of Americans as arrayed along a straight line, with the far left on one side and the far right on the other. They assume that the people at the edges are the most polarized, the most partisan, hold the most extreme ideological views, and are the most supportive of antidemocratic actions and violence. This is not the case. Consistent conservatives and liberals who are more politically engaged are both more affectively and ideologically polarized and more prodemocracy than those in the middle.42 A frequent misunderstanding is that people who hold ideological views that contain elements from both sides of the aisle are moderates because they fall in the middle of the left-right spectrum. In fact, a Democracy Fund survey in 2018 found that Americans who held the least polarized ideological beliefs were actually the voting cohort least in favor of democracy and most supportive of a “strong leader” who does not need to bother with Congress or elections.43 It is a common assumption that people who hold views from both sides of the aisle are economically conservative and socially liberal—the profile of many in the upper-middle-class political elite trying to reduce polarization. In fact, a 2016 study showed that this type of moderate ideology was held by only 3.8 percent of the electorate. Instead, the preponderance of Americans who respond to ideological survey questions with answers on both sides of the aisle (28.9 percent of the electorate) tend to be pro–economic redistribution while also upholding the belief that American citizens should be White, Christian, and born in the United States.44 That mix of views led this group to be swing voters for many years, although since 2016 many have moved more decisively into the Republican Party. This group, many of whom support an authoritarian leader and some of whom justify political violence when necessary to maintain traditional gender roles and a White-dominated racial hierarchy, may be highly affectively polarized—but they also may not be, since they tend to distrust all American institutions and elites.45 Some view themselves as strong partisan Republicans, so surveys such as Bright Line Watch found that people who strongly identified as Republican a year after the contested 2020 election were the most supportive of political violence.46 But others feel little partisan affiliation. They have voted for both parties in the past and seek someone to represent their views; if a third party of a Trumpian orientation emerged, they might switch to it. While they were united by their votes for Donald Trump in 2020 and their belief that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, they may be willing to mobilize in the future behind another strong, extreme leader: many of the most radical are no longer willing to turn out violently for Trump rallies because they feel let down by his failure to provide monetary support for those arrested on January 6.47 They are probably best characterized simply as the antidemocratic right, a growing counterculture with high distrust, a low sense of agency, and strong feelings of grievance and victimhood. On the left, the most partisan Democrats are actually far more moderate ideologically than progressives. In other words, on the left, extreme partisanship coincides with moderate ideology. The problem for democracy on the left is not those who report high polarization (those individuals tend to be active and politically engaged in a positive way for democracy), but a very small but vocal group that the international anti-polarization organization More in Common terms “activist mavericks.”48 These individuals are younger and wealthier than average Americans and more often male. They are far-left in their ideology, but they dislike the Democratic Party and so are not partisan (though they may be affectively polarized and hate Republicans). They claim to be very strongly prodemocratic. But they do not believe America has achieved democracy, and so they are willing to support political violence to achieve greater racial and democratic representation. Six in ten support property crime (versus 6 percent of Americans overall), and 28 percent support violence against people (versus 4 percent of the population overall). These two groups are asymmetric: the antidemocratic right is a plurality of somewhere between a quarter and a third of the Republican Party.49 The proviolence left is tiny and composes an insignificant part of the vote share of Democrats, especially since many may vote for third parties. Both are surrounded, however, by a penumbra of apologists and soft supporters who normalize their behavior. This has allowed the antidemocratic faction of the right to achieve a nearly complete takeover of the Republican Party that is giving it significant political power. Maverick activists on the left hold virtually no political power at any level of government, but their views have achieved outsized cultural sway. Despite their asymmetry, the bogeyman of these two groups is fueling the other and is the main force tearing the country apart—not a more generic or symmetrical polarization. Thus, it may be worth testing interventions focused precisely on these groups, as well as supporting independent, high-quality research alongside these programs to track behavioral outcomes over the short, medium, and long term. Or it might be worth testing interventions to build the prodemocracy habits and norms of Americans who are supportive of but not quite within these more virulent subcultures. To be of any use, these interventions and research must be done in real-world conditions, not just quick lab experiments, and studied over time.\n\nThe Literature on Polarization\n\nIn the 1950s, some influential U.S. scholars argued that America needed more polarization, which they defined as members of different parties holding differing policy beliefs. At the time, each of the two dominant parties encompassed a breadth of often overlapping political views thanks to conservative Southern Democrats and liberal Rockefeller Republicans. A famous American Political Science Review study from 1950 concluded that more polarization would help voters differentiate between the parties.50 These beliefs persisted among some of the most highly regarded scholars in the polarization field, such as the University of Pennsylvania’s Matthew Levendusky, well into the 2000s.51\n\nYet other experts took into account massive sociopolitical changes that affected how they viewed polarization. First came the Civil Rights Movement. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 sent former Southern Democrats into the Republican Party, accelerating a process of party sorting by ideology that was largely influenced by racial prejudice.52 Subsequent cultural cleavages over women’s rights, gay rights, and the environment, combined with polarization over the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal, continued the process of deepening ideological differences, while demographic sorting among the electorate put more liberals on the Democratic side and more conservatives on the Republican side of the aisle.53 A few crucial politicians, notably speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich, amplified these cleavages during the 1990s through a style of intensely partisan leadership that deepened the effects of these cultural and ideological differences on key institutions—in particular, Congress.54\n\nFirst Generation Understanding: Elite Ideological Polarization\n\nPolarization Is Policy Difference, Congress Is the Problem\n\nBy the early 2000s, members of Congress and people working on what was then called “good government” began to feel that polarization was a problem. They bemoaned a lack of compromise in Congress and a more poisonous atmosphere that appeared to be harming Congress’s ability to govern and undertake formerly uncontentious activities; for instance, the filibuster began to be routinely applied around 2010. They pointed to polarization as a core reason for the malfunctioning of Congress and other democratic institutions.\n\nPolitical scientists began to look into the issue and brought with them the tools of their discipline, which conceived of polarization as ideological distance between policy preferences. To measure that ideological distance in Congress, they used a dataset called DW-Nominate that looked at how members voted.55 Three seminal studies published between 2006 and 2015, including a task force convened by the American Political Science Association, summarized scholarly opinion.56 They found that:\n\nPolarization had risen in the Senate since the mid-1950s and in the House since the mid-1970s (see figure 2). That finding ruled out event-driven polarization such as president Bill Clinton’s impeachment. It also ruled out developments that happened well-after polarization had become entrenched, such as the rise of the right-wing movement known as the Tea Party, which created its own House caucus.57 In the House, the seven states with a single representative (districts that clearly cannot be gerrymandered) also had quite partisan representatives.58 Ideological polarization was highly asymmetric. Republican members of Congress were moving to the right ideologically much faster than Democratic members were moving to the left (see figure 3). Findings on ordinary Americans’ polarization were disputed. Polarization among the public seemed to depend on what scholars were measuring. Pew Research Center found growing antipathy as well as ideological distance among political activists that was bleeding into regular voters, but it also found that a broad center still held.59 Scholars who looked at self-identification found that conservatives were more likely to identify as Republicans and liberals as Democrats, suggesting that the parties were sorting by ideology much more than in past decades. Self-reporting also showed that ideological moderates had declined, and the self-described distance between mainstream Democrats and Republicans (not their respective activist wings) had doubled between 1972 and 2004.60 In fact, voters seemed to have the opposite asymmetry to their representatives: the share of Democrats who claimed to be liberal doubled between 1994 and 2014, and those who were consistently liberal quadrupled. Republican voters did not experience as much movement to the right or consolidation. Pew Research Center speculated that Democratic voters might be consolidating in reaction to Republican members of Congress moving to the right in a highly public way, such as with the release of Gingrich’s Contract With America.61 Scholars also found that voters were more likely to change their positions to match their party affiliation, rather than switching parties to support candidates who supported their positions.62 These findings suggested that the public was also polarizing over policy. However, two of the leading academics in the field of polarization studies, Morris Fiorina of Stanford University and Levendusky, argued strongly that the median voter remained a centrist on most issues.63 They found that Americans held a number of policy beliefs in common despite party affiliation, including on abortion, immigration, and gun rights.64 They also found that a broad group of voters held beliefs from both the left and right of the ideological spectrum and termed these individuals “moderates.” They concluded that Democrats and Republicans who were not political activists held far less unitary views than their own party elites, were more moderate ideologically, and therefore (since polarization was defined as ideological distance), Americans were mostly unpolarized. Their views held sway.\n\nHow Was America Polarized?\n\nScholars drew a number of conclusions from these findings about what was causing polarization and, therefore, what could be done to stop it.\n\nIdeological polarization was an elite issue. Polarization at the congressional level was worrisome but not deadly to democracy. It was causing difficulty with nominations to Congress and with legislation that broke along party lines. But it had not stopped major bipartisan legislation on important issues. Polarization among the American public was occurring, but it was largely among the politically engaged public, which was not the majority. There still seemed to be a broad middle, and there was disagreement about whether polarization even existed.65\n\nWhat Caused Elite Polarization?\n\nCompetition over power was likely to be playing a significant role. Since the country’s founding, congressional power was usually held by one party for decades at a time. But since 1980, it had been more up for grabs than in any period since the Civil War and Reconstruction, leading to more bare-knuckled politics and uglier campaigns as each election could be decisive for congressional control. The Gilded Age was another period in which control of Congress changed parties frequently because each party was close to 50 percent of the voting public. Frances Lee of Princeton University was the main proponent of this theory.66 One book-length study suggested the problem was that as the personal and financial costs of running for office increased and the benefits of holding office decreased, moderate candidates were disproportionately less likely to run, leaving the field to ideological extremes. The study, looking at all candidates who had run for House seats and not just the winners, found that all candidates had polarized significantly since the 1980s—so that whoever won would be more polarized, regardless of voter preferences.67 Further suggesting that the issue was structural and candidate-driven rather than voter-driven, another study found that in 2013, Republican party chairs at the county level preferred extreme candidates by a ten-to-one margin. Democratic party chairs also preferred extreme candidates, by a two-to-one margin. The safety of seats explains why both chairs preferred strong partisans but not why Republicans leaned so much more heavily in that direction.68 The rise in economic inequality in the United States appeared to be causing congressional ideological polarization—but congressional ideological polarization was also leading to increases in inequality, so causality was a vicious circle.69 Nolan McCarty, Keith T. Poole, and Howard Rosenthal found in 2007 that inequality exacerbated ideological polarization, and ideological polarization led to policies that further increased inequality. In other words, they found that people with vastly differential wealth had different policy preferences. But ideological differences between Republican and Democratic partisans led to the failure of redistributive policies, thus exacerbating inequality.70 Religious or evangelical voters were one of many factors—not the driving factor—behind polarization. Religiously driven political polarization was a concern at the time because of the organization of the Moral Majority and post-1980s evangelical movements.71 Gerrymandering was not the problem (in terms of polarization) that democracy activists believed it to be. Since the Senate was also polarized (in fact, had been polarizing for decades before the House had been), as were members who held impossible-to-gerrymander, single-state House districts, gerrymandering could at best be a modest cause of polarization.72 Voter sorting by geography was the greater cause of what looked like geographic polarization. The abolishment of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 may have caused polarization by allowing for greater media partisanship and self-selection into different news silos. When it was in effect, the Fairness Doctrine saw television news as a near monopoly because there were only three major channels, so it required news outlets to provide equal time to different ideological viewpoints; as the number of cable and radio news outlets grew, news appeared to be a more regular private market and president Ronald Reagan’s administration removed this requirement of equal time. That change meant partisans could self-select into media bubbles, while most Americans could opt out of news in favor of entertainment.73\n\n\n\nThere were also concerns that the way the media had started to cover the horse race of politics rather than policy issues led people to be more angered about their losses and that incivility in argumentation in order to increase drama and entertainment value encouraged a more black-and-white view of the world.74 Elite polarization among members of Congress was leading to greater partisan sorting of Americans into separate parties based on their policy preferences. Thus, solving the problems in Congress would help whatever polarization existed among the general public.75\n\nInterventions to Reduce Policy-Based Polarization Among Political Elites\n\nBased on this understanding of polarization, what was then best described as the “good government” field coalesced in the 2010s around the idea that the United States faced a problem of policy-based polarization among political elites. Therefore, many people working in the field of improving American governance concluded that the need was to find ways for Congress to compromise, negotiate, and break partisan incentive structures to win at all costs in order to win ultimate power.\n\nSome efforts were technical alterations to encourage compromise and working together, such as the House Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, a truly bipartisan congressional committee, assisted by outside help, that worked from 2019 to 2022 to improve congressional effectiveness and transparency, as well as other efforts to change congressional rules.\n\nto encourage compromise and working together, such as the House Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, a truly bipartisan congressional committee, assisted by outside help, that worked from 2019 to 2022 to improve congressional effectiveness and transparency, as well as other efforts to change congressional rules. Others were based on altering political incentives to encourage bipartisan cooperation. For instance, the Democratic House majority proposed bringing back earmarks, which allowed legislation to direct congressionally appropriated funds to specific uses in districts. Earmarks had been implicated in corruption and were banned by the Republican House majority in 2011. Yet they also incentivized compromise by giving members something of real worth to trade—taking a vote that could be difficult ideologically or could risk bringing on attack ads by an opponent in the next campaign could be neutralized if a member could show that they had brought home something desired by their district, such as funding for a new health center or bridge. Moreover, by letting members bring valued goods back to their districts, earmarks could show that the government was functioning for the people. 76\n\nFor instance, the Democratic House majority proposed bringing back earmarks, which allowed legislation to direct congressionally appropriated funds to specific uses in districts.

There was a lack of consensus and general skepticism that voting reforms, such as altering primaries, would reduce elite polarization. Fiorina and Levendusky argued that regular Americans were not very polarized. That accorded with findings in many other countries that partisan polarization tended to be an elite problem that had little effect on regular voters. If voters were more moderate than politicians, then electorates were not causing the polarization in Congress and electoral reform would not help. 77 Few reformers paid attention to the findings on candidates and how candidate incentives might be influenced by beliefs about campaigning and fundraising.\n\nFew reformers paid attention to the findings on candidates and how candidate incentives might be influenced by beliefs about campaigning and fundraising. The problem of growing inequality fit the data for when ideological polarization began in both chambers of Congress, but the good government field at the time generally paid little attention to economics.\n\nSecond Generation Understanding: Mass Affective Polarization\n\nPolarization Is Emotional Dislike Based on Identity That Affects Regular People\n\nBy 2016, experts were struggling to describe a landscape that appeared to have high mass public polarization, despite the fact that many scholars continued to find a great deal of overlap among Americans’ policy views on contentious issues.78\n\nScholars from new disciplines, such as political psychology and comparative politics, started to formulate a new hypothesis about what was occurring in the United States and other polarized democracies. Working separately and writing in hundreds of papers and books, these scholars crafted what became known as the idea of affective polarization:emotional dislike and disgust between members of opposing parties based not on policies but on identity.79 Partisans who were affectively polarized might actually overlap in their policy views (without knowing it due to misperceptions), or they might differ; policy alignment was not a good measure of emotional feelings.80 As political psychologist Lilliana Mason argued, “identity-based ideology can drive affective ideological polarization even when individuals are naïve about policy. The passion and prejudice with which we approach politics is driven not only by what we think, but also powerfully by who we think we are.”81 In some cases, differences in policy beliefs even appeared to shrink as affective polarization increased.82 Using measures based not on what policies people supported but on feeling thermometers ranking “warmth” or “coolness” toward the other party, trust and trait measures (such as asking if the other party was more hypocritical or more trustworthy), and social distance measures (such as “would you mind if your child married a member of the opposite party” and spousal agreement on party),83 scholars attempted to understand the public’s emotional state.\n\nScholars claimed that affective polarization was more destabilizing than policy polarization because it wove itself into a country’s social fabric. Different studies drew implications for the economy,84 health,85 and democracy itself. In particular, affective polarization seemed to allow one’s own political side to get away with undemocratic behavior to prevent the other side from winning, enabling the election of leaders who harmed democracy with the support of their base voters.\n\nThe international peace-building organization Beyond Conflict found that Republicans and Democrats who overestimated the degree of dehumanization, dislike, and disagreement between parties were more likely to support putting their political party over the general good of the country. They also found lower levels of trust in the country’s civic institutions, such as local and state governments or the Supreme Court, among those who overestimated the affective polarization of the other side. 86\n\nA survey of American voters found that they were less willing to support same-day voter registration if they were told that it would primarily benefit the other party. 87\n\nStudies by Milan Svolik and coauthors found in lab experiments in Türkiye, the United States, and Venezuela that the most polarized voters were the most willing to turn a blind eye to antidemocratic behavior committed by their party in order to prevent opponents from gaining control because they feared subversion by the other side.88 Actual voting data showed that Americans were willing to trade democratic principles for partisan loyalty or policy preferences and that only a small portion of Americans would prioritize democracy when these goals came into conflict.89 An online experiment by Alia Braley and coauthors with nearly 2,000 Americans found that voters were particularly willing to allow democratic norm-breaking by their side if they were credibly concerned that the other side wanted to break the rules—similar to the security dilemmas faced by countries locked in potential future conflict, where the incentive is to attack first if one fears being attacked.90\n\nHow Was America Polarized?\n\nThe American public is affectively polarized today, and affective polarization has been increasing steadily since the 1980s and possibly earlier, depending on the measurement used. (For one such measurement, see figure 4, based on data modeled by Massachusetts Institute of Technology election expert Charles Stewart III.) Since at least the mid-1990s, affective polarization had been growing for all age groups, but it had grown most quickly among people over sixty-five.91 Affective polarization is being driven primarily by dislike of the other party rather than positive feelings toward one’s own, since positive feelings toward one’s own party has also dropped slightly since the late 1980s (see upper lines in figure 4). Republicans reported liking their own party more in 2016, in correlation with the MAGA movement. Affective polarization, however, is quite symmetric across the parties.92 Affective polarization appears to be largely driven by misperceptions. Misperceptions about the actual demographic identities of the other party, the policy beliefs held by members of the other party, how much members of the other party disliked and disagreed with the respondents, and whether members of the other party supported democratic norm-breaking are all driving the problem.93 While the public feels a great deal of emotional dislike and polarization between the parties, ideological divergence in the mass public has not increased greatly over time.94 It is increasing somewhat: liberals are becoming more liberal on social issues and Democrats have moved to the left on racial issues since 2010, while Republicans have largely remained in the same place. Meanwhile, under the Biden administration, Republicans have started to move right on immigration.95 Yet most scholarship continues to agree with earlier findings that there is significant ideological overlap and agreement on policies, including on contentious issues such as guns and abortion, in part because there is a lot of ideological inconsistency in the parties—particularly with the move of a group of conservative but economically redistributive former swing voters into the Republican Party in 2016.96 However, it is worth noting that most Americans do not hold very intense policy beliefs; for many years, scholars have found that American voters alter their policy preferences to match their partisan identities. In contrast to Congress, which appears to be ideologically polarized, the problem for the public seems to be emotional rather than ideological—though some of the emotional polarization is based on real and perceived ideological differences among the activist edges of each party. Affective polarization has been rising much more rapidly in the United States than in most other Western countries (see figure 5). Attitudes across countries are notoriously hard to measure and compare; different systems of evaluation have yielded different measurements even when using the same data. However, most scholars agreed that America’s overall level of affective polarization, though rising, was only middling when compared with other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). A number of peer democracies with multiparty systems had higher levels of affective polarization but were showing much less democratic strain.97 That finding suggests that if affective polarization is harming U.S. democracy, it is not acting alone but is being exacerbated by other factors, such as the structure of the U.S. political system or the media environment.\n\n\n\nTrends in affective polarization also look very different across OECD democracies—rising in some, falling in others, and sometimes staying the same. That suggests that the United States’ swift rise in affective polarization has a domestic cause rather than being caused by an internationally systemic issue.\n\n\n\nScholars such as McCoy and Murat Somer have very different findings based on a different way of looking at polarization. Their measurement of “pernicious polarization” not only includes affective polarization but also considers whether the process of polarization has collapsed a variety of identities into two opposing camps that view each other with so much distaste, othering, and aversion that each group sees the other as immoral. It further considers whether politicians are using polarization as an instrumental strategy. Viewing polarization as a process rather than just an amount of dislike provides a way of measuring how hardened polarization is likely to be and whether there are negative feedback loops between public emotions and political incentives that create a fundamentally different environment than can be gauged by a single snapshot of mass feeling. Using this definition and measures based on expert opinion rather than self-reported feelings, their research finds that the United States is polarized at extraordinary rates compared to other countries and that no other wealthy, consolidated democracy has been as perniciously polarized for as long as the United States.98 This observation may be incorrect, as the expert data is subject to a presentism bias (since the measure was created recently and coded for past years). But it may also be more accurate than self-reported feeling thermometers because different countries report their feelings differently (that is, what feels like intense polarization to a Swede might feel quite mild to an American) and because their underlying definition of polarization is a better measure of antidemocratic attitudes than affective polarization alone.\n\nWhat Has Been Causing Affective Polarization?\n\nTheories of what has been driving affective polarization draw from psychology, sociology, comparative democracy, and political science. Each discipline sees the problem through the lenses it brings to the world. The problem could have many causes—there is no reason to believe it is only one. There is also no reason to believe that the same cause affects both parties equally—they could each be affectively polarized for different reasons. A number of theories that are common among the public are not supported by research. Eight major theories or explanatory narratives have emerged in recent years.\n\nStacked and sorted identities. People’s brains are wired to form in-groups for safety and then use shortcuts based on shared values, stories, symbols, and language to decide who is in and who is out. It is possible to prefer one’s own group without feeling much antagonism for an out-group (known as “in-group affinity”). But human brains are constantly scanning for threats to in-groups. As people affectively polarize, they appear to blow out-group threats out of proportion, exaggerating the out-group’s dislike and disgust for their own group and getting ready to defend their in-group, sometimes aggressively. Once polarization starts, it can become a vicious cycle because the human tendency toward motivated cognition seeks out information that proves these exaggerated beliefs and discounts information inconsistent with those beliefs.99 Mason and other scholars claim that polarization entered this cycle in the United States because of increasingly well-sorted parties. Americans have sorted themselves into parties based on their ideological affinities (meaning there are fewer liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats) at the same time that other racial, religious, sexual, geographic, and cultural identities have been increasingly aligned with partisanship.100 This “stacking” of identities within each party has allowed partisanship to become a social identity, not just a marker of one’s policy preferences.101 People with stacked identities are quicker to take offense when any of their identities are perceived to be maligned. So these in- and out-group dynamics are operating at high sensitivity, in which a threat against any one of many stacked identities can be perceived as an attack against one’s group.102 Geographic and social sorting. Other scholars point to people sorting into more homogenous groups of friends and geographic sorting,103 two factors that are leading people to socialize more with people they already agree with.104 Partisans may have incidentally self-sorted into different geographies because of preferences for urban or rural living or other factors. After that, they socialize with copartisans and their beliefs deepen as a result of that social homogeneity. This is not the same as self-sorting purposefully with the primary goal of living among copartisans, for which there are anecdotal claims but evidence is unclear. Mobility data and voter records suggest that people are moving because of other issues, such as jobs or the quality of public schools.105 However, these could be linked to partisan identity and ideology (that is, what one views as a quality school may differ based on ideology, or one could look for a job in another state because the laws in one’s current state feel threatening). Media bubbles. Another common claim is that Americans are sorting themselves into media echo chambers whose lack of balanced content further radicalizes and polarizes them.106 Social media is particularly singled out for its negative effects because its algorithms and business models have been shown to exacerbate outrage and anger.107 Social media has also been found to help recruit and provide platforms to extremists.108 However, scholarship is extremely mixed regarding the effects of social media.109 Four recent landmark studies by dozens of researchers conducting tests on tens of thousands of Facebook and Instagram accounts found that social media algorithms did not affect users’ polarization.110 While scholarship points in multiple directions, those findings support the preponderance of empirical studies that suggest, insofar as social media may be exacerbating affective polarization, the problem is small. And, the problem is not social media alone but the country’s entire media system. A recent literature review into media and social media in the United States found that media in general was likely increasing ideological and affective polarization. (It also noted significant methodological issues in the literature, particularly an overreliance on Twitter to measure social media usage, which is a problem because Twitter’s user demographics are not those of the median voter).111 Most studies do not find much correlation between internet news or social media use and affective polarization. That may be because most Americans do not use social media to discuss politics; politics is a very incidental part of life for most Americans, who largely avoid it.112 Scholars find that internet usage has increased similarly across Western Europe and in OECD countries, but affective polarization has skyrocketed in the United States while it has shown no consistent trend across OECD countries. Another cross-country study found that online news is slightly negatively correlated with affective polarization across countries—Americans get far less news online than Norwegians or Swedes, for instance, but affective polarization is rising in the United States while declining in the two other countries.113 Other studies argue that the internet only became a significant part of news in the 2000s, yet affective polarization has been growing since at least the 1980s and correlates more closely with the rise of cable news.114 (However, affective polarization from Democrats seems to have experienced a sharper rise since the early 2000s; see figure 6.) A large-scale experiment in which individuals deactivated their Facebook accounts for four weeks prior to the 2018 midterm elections did find that the deactivation reduced affective polarization, but only slightly.115 Meanwhile, affective polarization is growing most quickly among Americans over sixty-five years old. Yet younger Americans use more social media than older adults, while those over sixty-five spend more than six and a half hours a day in front of their televisions.116 Social media remains a problem for polarization, but in context. Multiple studies show that most Americans are not seeking out political news on social media, and so the loose connections they get through social media actually tend to bring them into connection with less polarizing news, rather than amplifying media bubbles. However, for the small segment of the public that is highly engaged with politics, social media is probably polarizing.117 Since nearly everyone running or funding efforts to reduce polarization is, by definition, highly engaged with politics, this group may overstate the effects of social media versus the entire media environment. Meanwhile, for violent individuals, particular sites are used for organizing, though the degree of radicalization occurring through those sites is unclear. In the United States, surveys (such as one by Public Religion Research Institute) find more intense and consistent negative democratic effects from far-right and right-wing cable news and radio companies and channels, such as Newsmax, One America News, and Fox News, rather than social media.118 Exposure to these offline forms of partisan news makes those with extreme attitudes even more extreme.119 Only one-tenth of insurrectionists arrested after the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol received most of their news from social media; most favored conservative television and radio.120 An experiment in which people were incentivized to shift from watching Fox News to CNN showed that further exposure to partisan outlets, such as Fox News, was radicalizing and that incentivizing a shift from Fox to CNN led to more accurate and less polarized information.121 But causation is unclear: people who are more polarized might also be more motivated to watch partisan news. After Fox News made an early call during the November 2020 election that the majority of Arizonans had voted for Biden for president, 37 percent of the network’s prime-time viewers chose to move their viewership temporarily to more extreme outlets, such as Newsmax and One America News, that reported for months that a Trump victory was possible (or had actually occurred). Viewers were shaping the content, rather than being led by it.122 Similarly, after Fox News fired its most popular host, the right-wing personality Tucker Carlson, viewership plummeted—while viewership increased during the same period at Newsmax.123 More polarized people may also be more motivated to engage with polarizing social media. Studies of YouTube showed that most engagement with extremist content was largely confined to a small, concentrated group of people who had preexisting, negative views on gender and race.124 And while partisan traditional news sources do seem to exacerbate polarization in America, in Europe there is little evidence to suggest that exposure to partisan or populist traditional media causes widespread polarization.125 It could be that social media and partisan traditional media are having more polarizing effects in America than elsewhere because of other factors. For instance, having a trusted media source—whether a national source of record or a strong local news source—might mitigate the polarizing effects of social and partisan media. In the United States, no single news source is trusted by more than 50 percent of Americans, while in the United Kingdom, for example, 86 percent of Britons say that they are satisfied with their state broadcasting service.126 Countries that spend more on public broadcasting have seen greater decreases in polarization, though the direction of causality is unclear.127 In the United States, it is possible that local news played the mediating, trusted role that a government broadcaster plays in some other democracies and that the decline of local news is enhancing affective polarization. One study found that after communities lost a local newspaper, voters were less likely to split their ticket in federal elections.128 The decline of local news has also been linked to lower voter turnout and citizen engagement in general.129 Inequality and economics. While ideological polarization in Congress is correlated with inequality, inequality’s relationship with affective polarization is much less clear—in part because there are very few studies on it. One multicountry study found that high inequality and unemployment were correlated with greater affective polarization; however, another study using the same data but a different evaluation method found that the role of inequality no longer held. 130\n\nOther studies looking across countries suggest that inequality is poorly correlated with affective polarization. For instance, affective polarization has been falling in Australia at the same time as inequality has been rising, while affective polarization is rising quickly in Denmark while income inequality is quite low. In the Netherlands, affective polarization is growing relatively swiftly while income inequality is also low (though wealth inequality is higher). 131\n\nIn Belgium, affective polarization is distributed quite differently in different parts of the country. One study found that differences in economic performance over the past few years drove affective polarization, particularly if wealthier areas were located near poorer places. But the rural/urban divide also still mattered, separate from these dynamics. 132\n\nOne theoretical model suggests that inequality could contribute to polarization by encouraging people who are more risk averse due to a harder economic environment to limit their interactions to in-group members.133 Low levels of social trust are associated with these people being more risk averse and retreating to doing business within their in-group.134 But if inequality is having these effects, its role needs to be teased out from other factors that could be lowering social trust. Economic shocks. Some research suggests that calamitous economic shocks—such as the Great Depression and the 2008–2009 financial crisis—increase support for populist parties that denigrate social out-groups and thus cause affective polarization.135 However, globally, populist parties began winning power in 2000, prior to the 2008–2009 financial crisis, though the crisis may have increased their success: populist leaders hit their modern peak in 2018. If economic shocks are exacerbating affective polarization by leading voters to elect populist candidates, then inequality is mediated through populist political leaders who interpret economic realities and is not a direct cause. Michael Podhorzer’s analysis of majority-White congressional districts showed that after the 2008–2009 financial crisis, the majority-White districts that voted Republican (prior to or after the shock) had a much slower economic recovery than those that voted for Democrats (see figure 7).136 These trends in recovery strongly correlate with rural-versus-urban geographies (see figure 8).137 Affective polarization among the American public had started long before 2008. But these trends—given direction by a concerted effort at political organizing by deep-pocketed donors—could explain the rise of the Tea Party, which firmly moved affective polarization from a feeling into a political force that led to candidates getting elected. These are the ways in which emotion, mediated by political incentives and politicians, can create changes to democracy. Another financial shock that may have played a role is the rise in Chinese imports, which, according to one study, reduced U.S. manufacturing jobs and increased unemployment, particularly among non-college-educated groups.138 Meanwhile, the regions most affected by reduced employment due to Chinese imports shifted their media viewing toward Fox News. Majority-White regions most affected by the substitution of Chinese imports for local jobs were more likely to elect a Republican congressperson and majority-minority regions a Democratic one.139 Racial resentment. People holding hostile attitudes toward racial minorities had been found within both parties throughout the twentieth century. They began moving to the Republican Party after the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The 2016 election was another punctuation point, when a new group of voters scoring high on racial resentment moved from being Democrats or swing voters into the Republican Party.140 A study of 5,000 Americans conducted throughout the 2016 election found that White Trump supporters adopted more racially hostile views toward Black Americans over the course of the campaign in line with their preferred candidate’s rhetoric.141 Nathan Kalmoe and Mason found that White Republicans with higher levels of minority resentment were also more likely to see Democrats as evil or subhuman—that is, to be affectively polarized.142 These alterations coincided with Republicans holding a more racialized view of the Democratic Party (thinking of the party as containing a larger number of minorities than was accurate).143 Meanwhile, for approximately a decade, Democrats had been moving to the left on racial issues.144 Status anxiety. Economics and race may work together to create a sense of fear and othering. The idea that fear of economic scarcity exacerbates racism is corroborated by experiments showing that in a lab context, White Americans primed to be thinking about economic scarcity reduce resource allocations to Black Americans.145 The problem may be linked to the idea of relative deprivation: when individuals feel deprived of success they had anticipated achieving or felt they deserved, they can experience a sense that they deserve better than their current situation and that someone else is to blame.146 Usually these grievances must be articulated and exploited by a conflict entrepreneur or political leader, and until that person or movement comes along, structural inequality per se does not move people into extremism. Consider again the rise of the Tea Party. As voters face greater economic precarity in general, particularly following a shock, they become more attuned to further threats and are more sensitive to political appeals that out-group members are supposedly taking their rightful place. Affective polarization grows because of the confluence of economic precarity, status threat, and the existence of a leader or common narrative that blames the situation on particular people or causes. The need for other factors to interact with economics may be why other markers such as living in poverty, being working class, being unemployed, and fearing economic loss do not correlate with support for nativist or xenophobic parties in the United States or Europe.147 Some research suggests that nativism (which is not the same as affective polarization but is potentially linked) may be most attractive to those doing less well relative to others within a growing economy—even if those individuals are doing better than they previously had been. For instance, many of the poorest European countries have not seen a major rise in nativist parties, while countries with relatively high employment and prosperity (such as Austria and the Netherlands), as well as regions with expanding economies and employment (such as Saxony and Brandenburg in Germany), have seen rising nativism.148 Poverty also has no correlation with political violence.149 In fact, domestic terrorists are, if anything, slightly better educated and more wealthy than other Americans.150 Politicians and political incentives. Other scholars pointed to the particular role of political leaders and structural incentives in stoking affective, identity-based polarization to win elections. The literature suggests three mechanisms. Personality or individual-level explanations: The rise of populist leaders suggested some politicians’ personalities led them to use polarization as their means to create intense ties to their voting base and thus win elections. 151 For instance, countries such as Brazil and Poland, which were previously fairly unpolarized, polarized quickly during the campaigns and under the governments of populist leaders. Meanwhile, in Hungary, a politician drew on old but long-submerged fissures to scapegoat portions of society (which did not exactly polarize because there were not many minorities to form the other “pole”). 152\n\nFor instance, countries such as Brazil and Poland, which were previously fairly unpolarized, polarized quickly during the campaigns and under the governments of populist leaders.

Structural incentives: Others pointed to political incentives in both places with close races where control over power was under dispute and in places with first-past-the-post, winner-take-all systems in which moving a tiny number of voters might give a politician a total win over a district or country. 153 Majoritarian systems seem to favor affective polarization by creating a binary of political actors. 154 For this reason, political scientists have recommended a broad array of structural changes to America’s two-party, winner-take-all system to affect these incentives. 155\n\nMajoritarian systems seem to favor affective polarization by creating a binary of political actors. For this reason, political scientists have recommended a broad array of structural changes to America’s two-party, winner-take-all system to affect these incentives. Campaign incentives: Negative campaigns also seemed to play a role. Across recent election cycles, voters were 50–150 percent more affectively polarized by Election Day than they were a year earlier. Political advertisements, especially negative advertising, had particularly strong effects on affective polarization.156\n\nInterventions to Reduce Affective Polarization\n\nThese findings led to a diverse set of early experiments to bring down affective polarization. Four strands of such work have received the most scholarship.\n\nCorrect misperceptions about the other party, one-on-one or through broader awareness campaigns. Since people who are affectively polarized are known to hold erroneous beliefs and perceptions about the other party, one path that initially appeared promising was correcting these misbeliefs. Correct misperceptions based on identity. Democrats tend to think Republicans are wealthier, older, and more evangelical than they are (for instance, believing that over a third of Republicans earned over $250,000 when the reality is 2 percent), while Republicans think Democrats are more often members of unions and more likely to be atheists, sexual minorities, or people of color (for instance, believing that nearly a third of Democrats were members of the LGBT community while the reality is six percent). Like ideological misperceptions, these demographic misbeliefs are strongest among those who are more politically informed. They increase the feeling that the average member of the other group has little in common with themselves and increase animus. 157 In fact, the modal member of both parties is a middle-aged, White, nonevangelical Christian. In one set of lab experiments, scholars found that when respondents’ misperceptions about the demographics of the other party were corrected, affective polarization decreased. 158 Because many people hold biases against the other party’s stereotypical groups, correcting these biases back to the modal member helps—though done without care, correcting misperceptions can further the implicit connection between Whiteness, Christianity, and heterosexuality with “Americanness” (see the discussion in point 2). 159\n\nCorrect misperceptions based on policies. People who are affectively polarized may dislike one another and be unaware that their policy beliefs overlap. Multiple studies found that when partisans were made aware that they shared policy beliefs across parties, their affective polarization declined.160 This finding suggested that although affective polarization is emotional, it may still have a strong policy basis and thus could be changed by correcting misperceptions about policies supported by the other side. Some studies found that issue positions influenced feelings about the other party more than partisanship. If voters learned they shared the same policy beliefs, they rated each other more warmly. Those feelings cooled if they learned they were in different parties, but they were still warmer than feelings toward copartisans who held different political beliefs.161 Another study, part of Stanford University’s Strengthening Democracy Challenge, found that watching a short video in which Democrats and Republicans discovered they shared more common ground than they previously believed reduced affective polarization.162 Increase the salience of a common identity. Multiple studies suggested that efforts to create a “superordinate identity,” or a common, overarching identity, could reduce affective polarization. The “one-group” model emphasizes a shared identity that encapsulates members of all groups. For instance, Levendusky used the Fourth of July to prime American identity and the killing of Osama bin Laden to prime a common threat. He found emphasizing these things that Americans share could reduce partisan animus.163 This was in keeping with other studies that have consistently found that emphasizing a shared, single group membership reduces intergroup bias.164 However, America’s partisan polarization is interwoven with racial identity, creating an important caveat. Some scholarship has found that subordinating minority identity to a common identity (that is, “we are all Americans”) makes minorities less interested in engaging over time.165 Even if minority individuals are willing to engage in the intervention program, they tend to reassert their minority or subgroup identities, often with some intensity.166 As minority individuals reassert their minority identities (such as claiming that language like “we are all Americans” risks erasing the specific histories of their groups), other people in the intervention may respond with an increase in bias (for instance, feeling that the strong assertion of minority identity is the reason Americans cannot get along).167 Other scholars worry that insofar as creating a superordinate American identity does reduce polarization, it may do so by further associating American identity with Whiteness. Not only could such associations exclude minorities from American identity, but also, the implicit connection between race and American identity could enhance divides as the United States transitions to a country with an increasing proportion of minorities. In other words, so long as the modal member of both parties is White, increasing the salience of American identity reduces partisan prejudice. But efforts to create a single identity can implicitly engage race: for instance, asking people to recall the imagery of America’s founding may implicitly call to mind images of White people. If there is a mismatch between the concept of American identity as White and the actual composition of the opposing party, increasing the salience of American identity could actually correlate with higher levels of partisan hostility.168 For these reasons, scholars have tried interventions that emphasize both a common American identity and other identities. A 2011 study found that this “dual identity” approach maintained the willingness of disadvantaged groups to engage.169 A 2013 study found that this dual identity approach enabled majority groups to recognize and decrease prejudice against minority groups in America, and studies of other countries showed it worked in reducing prejudice.170 Bring groups together to have social relationships across difference.171 Often called “bridging programs,” these interventions are based on a tradition of intergroup contact theory that dates back to the 1960s and was developed predominantly in reaction to America’s racial divide. In the United States, programs usually bring people together who self-identify as Republican or Democratic to talk across that divide, often to talk about the divide or about divisions on policy issues. Years of scholarship show that programs like these can reduce prejudice if they are very well moderated.172 However, a 2021 meta-analysis of the extensive literature on intergroup contact theory found serious limitations in applying this theory to political polarization.173 The majority of the studies were conducted with young adults and teenagers, whose identities are still in formation, but interventions are being applied to older adults whose identities are fully formed. Studies largely focused on overcoming prejudice based on characteristics that individuals are born into, such as race and religion, but there is no evidence that the theory continues to work when applied to political identities that people choose and that they may be held morally culpable for holding. Most studies were too small to know whether they could scale. Meanwhile, evidence suggests that these programs work only under tightly circumscribed conditions: for instance, participants across a divide must be of the same economic class. If these programs are run poorly or preconditions are not met, they can backfire and deepen bias. Make structural alterations to electoral systems. A number of scholars have suggested an array of structural alterations to electoral systems. These are sometimes framed as a way to reduce affective polarization but are more commonly discussed as a way to reduce political incentives to polarize the public or to reduce the likelihood of more extreme partisans or antidemocratic personalities getting elected. Intervention suggestions include forms of proportional representation, such as requiring states with more than a minimum number of districts to elect half of their congressional delegations by individual districts and the other half at large, whether from the entire state at large or from larger, nongerrymandered regions;174 abolishing primaries or making primaries nonpartisan, in which all candidates run and the top two vote getters qualify for the general election;175 instituting ranked choice voting, which is supported both for its possible effects in getting around polarizing primaries and because it may reduce negative campaigning based on a study by the advocacy organization FairVote;176 and finally, setting up proportional representation systems, which allows a broader spectrum of political options to gain representation and ensures that no significant percentage of the population fails to get represented because it represents a minority within a given geography in the way winner-take-all systems allow.177\n\nThird Generation Understanding: Cracks in the Foundations\n\nReducing Affective Polarization May Not Impact Violent or Antidemocratic Attitudes\n\nMore recent data, however, has introduced some core challenges for any interventions that are intended to reduce affective polarization alone.\n\nA number of recent studies have found that interventions to decrease affective polarization can change participants’ feelings toward members of the other party. But they don’t seem to affect the antidemocratic or violent attitudes and behaviors that were supposedly being caused by affective polarization.178\n\nA study of the interventions in Stanford’s Strengthening Democracy Challenge (which tested short, online interventions on 30,000 participants) found that many of the lab interventions reduced partisan animosity immediately, and some effects even persisted two weeks later.179 But the interventions did not reduce antidemocratic attitudes or justifications for political violence. In fact, one intervention that was based on creating a shared identity as an “exhausted majority” actually increased support for antidemocratic practices. Meanwhile, a video that graphically depicted social instability and violence in collapsing democracies around the world reduced affective polarization while increasing conservative Republican support for political violence (possibly because it included footage of January 6).180 A separate study by an overlapping group of researchers used three completely different tests on the findings from the Strengthening Democracy Challenge. They also found that interventions that reduced affective polarization in lab environments did not seem to affect antidemocratic attitudes.181 A third study with different researchers conducted five different lab-based tests and agreed that affective polarization is linked to how people feel interpersonally about the other party’s members, but it is not related to their support for partisan views, policy positions, or democratic norms, nor is it related to how people react to actual information about their real representatives and other tested political effects.182\n\nStepping back from the interventions, these scholars also looked at whether affective polarization was even correlated with antidemocratic attitudes or political violence. They found that social distrust, partisan animosity, and biased evaluation of politicized facts (all hallmarks of affective polarization) did group together. But these factors were not correlated closely with support for undemocratic practices, political violence, and undemocratic candidates, and interventions that affected the first set of variables that characterize affective polarization did not necessarily affect the second set of variables, which were what researchers ultimately wanted to change.183 Subsequent testing by an overlapping group of researchers using different tests found that there was no reliable correlation between affective polarization and antidemocratic attitudes or political violence.184 These findings echo the literature review on intergroup contact theory, which showed that bridging programs can be successful at changing the feelings of the people who participate but provided no evidence that changing such feelings will affect individuals’ actual behaviors, such as voting for antidemocratic candidates or supporting political violence.185\n\nAntidemocratic Attitudes\n\nA few interventions within the Strengthening Democracy Challenge were found to reduce both affective polarization and antidemocratic attitudes. These were interventions that reassured participants that the other side was not going to undermine democracy itself.\n\nOne intervention that reduced antidemocratic attitudes was a video showing Utah’s gubernatorial candidates from both parties committing themselves to honor the results of the 2020 election. Another program corrected misperceptions about the other party’s willingness to engage in antidemocratic behaviors, such as reducing the number of polling stations, refusing to accept election results, or using violence to block laws.186\n\nLearning that partisans on the other side were not so bent on playing dirty and destroying democracy reduced support for antidemocratic actions from one’s own side.187 That intervention found support from other scholars who showed that voter decisions to support an antidemocratic candidate seem sensible if they think the harm from their decision is small while the consequences of the opposition winning are catastrophic to democracy.188 These findings by scholars such as Svolik previously cited affective polarization as a cause, but in fact, they could be right about their empirical findings but wrong about the cause. Newer research suggests that the problem is not general feelings of dislike for the other party but instead specific fears that the other party will undermine democracy.\n\nPolitical Violence\n\nThe data do not support the idea that affective polarization directly causes political violence. In fact, justifying political violence seems separate from both affective polarization and antidemocratic attitudes. That makes sense given what is known about violence; the literature suggests it has much more to do with personality and self-control than emotions or ideology.\n\nIn addition to the lab tests and survey responses already described that show a lack of correlation between attitudes supporting political violence and affective polarization, other facts do not match. For instance, Democrats are about equally affectively polarized as Republicans. In fact, from 2017 to 2020—the years for which Kalmoe and Mason published survey data—political violence justifications were nearly as common (and sometimes more preval", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/05"}, {"url": "https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15462.doc.htm", "title": "Amid Increasingly Dire Humanitarian Situation in Gaza, Secretary ..."}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/world/singer-madonna-defends-blowing-up-the-white-house-remark-idUSKBN15707A/", "title": "Singer Madonna defends 'blowing up the White House' remark ..."}]}

You see, honey cake is something traditionally eaten on the Jewish New Year (Rosh Hashanah), which falls next week as eating honey is supposed to encourage a sweet New Year, doubly so if paired with apples.\n\nBut every honey cake I have been forced to try has been wretched (apologies if it was yours). They were dry and never sweet enough. They were coarse and totally unloved. And if I find myself at an occasion where I see a honey cake, well, I wonder why they didn’t ask me to make dessert instead, but then I steer clear of it just the same. This life is too short to eat terrible cake.\n\nI said as much to this reader, and that’s when it hit me: Right, this is my job! This is what I do! I take things that I think are terrible and I try to find a better way to go about them. That’s why this person emailed me, right? (Sometimes I forget.) And seeing as I don’t dislike honey, and I don’t hate spices and I don’t hate tradition or the Jewish New Year, well, it was time.\n\nI did a bit of research and learned that there was a recipe out there by one cookbook author Marcy Goldman that everyone is quite mad for — in a good way. And I was feeling pretty good about the copious tastes I’d had of the batter (um, before remembering how much booze was in there and look at that! It’s party time in here!) when it went in the oven but then.\n\nWell then something terrible skitted across the floor and I just don’t want to talk about it. I screamed–like movie starlet screamed, ungh–and dropped the spatula. And by the time I got off the phone with Alex [“Come home NOW. Come home NOW. Come home NOW.”] and somewhat talked myself off my I’m-leaving-NYC-and-never-coming-back ledge, I realized that the cakes had fallen in the oven.\n\nAnd now, dear reader, I am torn as to whether this recipe needs to come with a warning. Was it my scream and the ensuing trauma that made the cakes fall? Are there issues with my baking soda (quite likely, it’s old as dirt)? Is there something wrong with this cake recipe? (I doubt this, nobody else who has mentioned it made reference to a sunken midsection.) Are you completely horrified that I shared this story (despite my mother asking me nicely to spare you our shameless details)?\n\nI’ll tell you what I do know, though: This honey cake is perfect. It’s warmly spiced and crazy moist and soft and plush with a little crisp edge about the corners and if you know someone with a thing for honey cake, be they bringing in the year 5769 with revelry or not, you’ve got to wow them with this one. Concave or not, it is everything honey cake was once supposed to be, and with this recipe, might be again. [Note: The concavity of the cake has since been remedied, hooray.]\n\n2023 Note: It has been fifteen years since I first shared this cake, which is crazy as I haven’t gotten any older at all. If you grew up with dry or bland and heavy honey cakes for Rosh Hashanah — the Jewish new year in which eating honey symbolizes our hopes for sweetness in the year ahead — Marcy Goldman’s honey cake is a dream: plush, fragrant and phenomenally delicious. Yes, it has 17 ingredients and yes they’re as seemingly random as orange juice, coffee, and whiskey but together they’re exceptional, as special as a cake you make once a year should be.\n\nHowever, I’m long overdue to update the recipe with some of the minor changes I’ve made over the years, and to address ongoing questions and concerns (like the cake sinking, reference in the post). I hadn’t meant to make this cake approximately 10 times in a 6-week period, but hey, my apartment smells amazing and nobody minds. A rundown of notes, tweaks, and updates are at the end of the recipe.\n\nVideo", "authors": ["Anita Meddin", "Deb", "Not The Author", "Rebekah Baylus", "Marilyn Sobel", "Alice Thorner", "Audrey Glick", "Judy Margolis", "Kelly S.", "Sandy Z."], "publish_date": "2008/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.tiktok.com/@imjustwasim/video/7330214284057693470", "title": "Ditch Red Bull for Organic Black Coffee | Healthier Energy ..."}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-people-say-pasta-is-like-eating-empty-calories-yet-Italian-people-eat-it-regularly-and-are-very-healthy", "title": "Why do some people say pasta is like eating “empty” calories yet ..."}, {"url": "https://www.tiktok.com/discover/mix-gummy-drink?lang=en", "title": "Mix Gummy Drink | TikTok"}, {"url": "https://thebalancedblonde.com/2014/06/23/why-im-transitioning-away-from-veganism/", "title": "Why I'm Transitioning Away from Veganism… | The Balanced Blonde", "text": "In the last few weeks it’s become clear to me how silly it is that I am so afraid to share this on the blog and in my life.

My roasted veggies and quinoa for dinner were not satisfying me like they once had, and my green smoothies for breakfast were giving me stomach aches and making me feel bloated and overly full. I was shocked! This plant-based lifestyle I had so adored and built my career around was “failing” me… Or so I believed.\n\nI spent the next several months ignoring my body’s internal cues. I longed to try new things that looked and sounded good to me, but ethically I couldn’t do it. I had done so much research, read so many books, watched so many documentaries and personally connected with so many vegans and those against eating animal protein, and I believed wholeheartedly in the lifestyle. I felt that I knew better than to eat animal protein. I was educated, I had will power, and I loved being vegan.\n\nThat’s what I kept telling myself. And most days, I believed it. Other days, I knew that I was going to have to eat a bowl of veggies the size of a monster truck to fill me up. Some days, I could hardly eat at all because my biochemistry was so thrown off. Some days, I had wild and ravenous sugar cravings that took over my mind and hindered me from focusing on anything else.\n\nI also started fearing a LOT of things when it came to food. Having grown up with a notoriously sensitive stomach, I already avoided wheat, fried foods, sauces, oil, flour of any type, some legumes and many grains. Then I started reading about raw foods, digestion, food combining, the space at which meals should be eaten apart from each other, and the dangers of even all-natural fructose. (And let’s not forget my bout with 80/10/10 raw veganism.)\n\nI started living in a bubble of restriction. Entirely vegan, entirely plant-based, entirely gluten-free, oil-free, refined sugar-free, flour-free, dressing/sauce-free, etc. and lived my life based off of when I could and could not eat and what I could and could not combine. There is nothing wrong with any of those things (many of them are great, actually!!) but my body didn’t feel GOOD & I wasn’t listening to it.\n\nDoes that sound crazy to you?\n\nYeah, it sounds crazy to me too. My wake up call came when one of my best friends was in town and we went to get smoothies at Juice Press before spending the day in Central Park. We went to Juice Press because I was the difficult one– I was very limited when it came to breakfast foods, and my friends suggested Juice Press knowing it would make things easier on everyone.\n\nI knew which juice I wanted long before we headed over… A green juice with a tiny bit of apple but not their green juice with more apple juice because that one was too sugary. (If you’re familiar with JP, I wanted ‘Series B’.) We got there, and they didn’t have it. I stared at the juices and smoothies and raw food for a good 15 minutes, panicking, because I had no idea how I was going to navigate this setback. By this time my two friends already had their smoothies and were nearly done with them. Since they’ve known me forever and they know my issues with decision making… They were patient.\n\nEventually my roomie Katie suggested we walk to a different Juice Press location, a mile out of our way, to get the juice I wanted. I was so relieved… Or so I convinced myself. My stomach was in knots because I had hardly eaten for days, and my body wasn’t sure it could even walk a mile without any sustenance. And we were at a raw food juice bar! A place where everything on the menu was vegan! I should NOT have been feeling so limited and so helpless.\n\nWe walked, I got my juice, sipped it, and was still starving. I needed FOOD & I wasn’t allowing myself to have it for 5 billion reasons in my head that are hard to explain but you’re starting to get the picture.\n\nThings continued to spiral downward for a few more weeks… When my mom and sister were in town, I don’t think I enjoyed a single meal with them. I ate before or after seeing them, panicked that the food at the restaurants we were going to was going to make me feel like crap and throw off my system.\n\nI was also addicted to juice cleanses. I felt that if I cleansed my body like I had done successfully so many times in the past, these cravings and hunger pains and disordered habits would go away.\n\nI knew I had disordered eating habits, but until I was willing to admit I had developed some variation of an eating disorder I wasn’t going to be able to do anything about it. One night over dinner with my dear friend Tara, someone who I owe every ounce of my realization to… I started to accept it. It kind of came to me all at once – entirely shocking and strangely unsurprising at the same time.\n\nThen I continued to accept it. And I cannot tell you how freeing that was.\n\nI’m not writing about it because I think it’s normal to share such personal aspects of one’s life in such a public place… I actually think it’s very abnormal, and it is counterintuitive for me to be doing this. I’m writing about it because I value you as my readers and friends tremendously, and I think it’s time we ditch the labels.\n\nIt’s time to advocate a lifestyle that doesn’t involve restriction, labeling or putting ourselves into a box. I am extremely passionate about eating ethically and eating whole, plant-based foods from the earth. My original passion for health stemmed from learning about real foods and how they affect our bodies versus chemically-produced and factory farmed disgustingness that is not food.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean that living life in moderation is a sin. It’s a beautiful thing… To accept moderation, to accept balance, to allow for happiness and growth and change and fluctuation. Life is an ebb and flow, and our bodies and our mindsets evolve! It is okay to embrace that, and it’s detrimental to our health and our well being not to.\n\nMy body was trying to speak to me for many months and I did not listen. As a result, I grew extremely deficient in a variety of vitamins and hormones and knocked myself way out of whack. I injured my ankle doing something that would have never injured me in the past, I lost my period for several months and I experienced a major lack of energy. I ignored my body’s internal cues… And that wasn’t cool.\n\nSo, long story short, I am reevaluating my diet. I’m saying goodbye to the labels. I’ve tried organic farm fresh eggs and wild fish from the local farmer’s market. I had some sashimi from an organic restaurant that I very much trust. All in the last couple of weeks. This is terrifying for me and extremely out of my comfort zone after living under the vegan umbrella for so long, but I’m doing it for my physical and mental health.\n\nI am getting help in other areas too, and I am beyond okay with admitting that. I have always been a huge advocate of therapy and getting to know oneself on a deeper label, and I feel very lucky to be connecting with myself in a whole new way.\n\nThis doesn’t mean you are going to see me at a hole in the wall burger joint eating cheeseburgers and downing milkshakes. I still believe in ethical, sustainable food that comes from as close to the earth as possible… Farm raised, locally grown and as organic as can be. I am still against factory farming and the lies that the food industry hides behind, and I still love animals and am as passionate about their rights as ever before.\n\nI am simply taking my health into my own hands, and I am encouraging you to do the same. My philosophy has shifted, and rightfully so. When I came up with the name The Blonde Vegan I was a full-fledged vegan girl who was still in college and had just discovered plant-based eating and was totally enamored by it.\n\nPlants are amazing! Vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts and legumes are beautiful foods from the earth and should be incorporated into as many meals as possible throughout the day. But that’s not ALL that is out there. Some of us need more in order to fuel or bodies properly– especially those of us with extreme “all or nothing” personalities like my own.\n\nVegan diets can absolutely work if you’re eating a balanced diet. One example, my friend Katie has been vegan for 12 years and lives an extremely healthy lifestyle. She is balanced, and has not experienced the restrictive aspects of the diet like I did. I know countless other people who thrive off of a plant-based diet. I did, for quite some time. And I absolutely respect anyone who chooses that lifestyle. I still think it’s amazing. But sometimes, in some bodies, things change and we have to pay attention to that.\n\nThat’s the point… we are all different!\n\nI have changed, and I ask for your support and acceptance, which I can most assuredly tell you I will give to all of you. ❤\n\nThat being said… I’m in the market for a new blog name. I am heart broken about this because The Blonde Vegan has become an extension of who I am, and it will always be a part of me. But as I move my brand forward I do not want to confuse people about my philosophy and what I stand for. As a health coach, I want to help other people learn to eat in the best possible way for their bodies. I want to work with people who have developed “orthorexia,” as I have, and I don’t believe TBV will serve me as a name for those purposes.\n\nLove to all of you. Please share your thoughts with me on all of this. It feels good to be honest, but it’s freaking terrifying. Love to my vegans and love to everyone else– I am still the same compassionate girl I was yesterday, last month and last year.\n\n*ADDENDUM: I have written a memoir about my transition experience, Breaking Vegan, that is now available for pre-order.

It was the worst verdict on a sitting prime minister by their own party in recent times.\n\nAlthough Johnson and his allies claimed the vote as a victory, many Conservative MPs including some of his supporters believe the attempted coup is the beginning of the end for his three-year premiership.\n\nWith so many of his party having voted against him, the prime minister has effectively lost his majority support in parliament, with the risk that his government is paralysed.\n\nJohnson is theoretically safe from another leadership challenge for a year under the rules of the 1922 Committee – but Theresa May was forced to leave office just six months after a winning a confidence ballot, having been terminally damaged despite winning by 200 votes to 117.\n\nThe proportion of MPs who voted against Johnson is even greater than the votes against May in 2018 and Margaret Thatcher in 1990. Thatcher resigned a week later.\n\nSpeaking after the result, Johnson insisted it was an “extremely good, positive, conclusive, decisive result” that would allow him to “move on to unite and focus on delivery”. He also claimed he had “won a far greater mandate” from colleagues than he did in his 2019 leadership election, although critics cast doubt on that claim. Johnson also declined to rule out calling a snap election, although he said he was “not interested” in that idea.\n\n2:48 The day in three minutes: Boris Johnson wins no-confidence vote – video\n\nNadhim Zahawi claimed Johnson had “won handsomely” and he hoped the result would “draw a line under all the speculation from the media and Twitterati”, leading to a “united party”.\n\nThe education secretary also claimed that Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, would be “punching the air” at the result.\n\nJames Cleverly, the Foreign Office minister, called it a “comfortable” and “clear” win for Johnson, while the MP for Lichfield, Michael Fabricant, said the result was a “lot better” than he had feared.\n\nHowever, rebel MPs said Johnson should quit for the good of the party and the country. Sir Roger Gale, one of Johnson’s leading critics, said a “prime minister of honour” should realise he had lost the support of a sizeable number of his MPs. He suggested rebels would continue to oppose Johnson remaining as prime minister.\n\nThe scale of the rebellion means some government ministers and aides must have voted against Johnson in the secret ballot, while remaining publicly supportive.\n\nOne former cabinet minister said he believed Johnson could soon face other attempts to oust him if the Tories lose in two byelections on 23 June, or the prime minister is found by a parliamentary inquiry to have misled the House of Commons. “The role of the chief whip will be key,” he said. “It would be his role to tell the prime minister he has lost his cabinet.”\n\nKeir Starmer, the Labour leader, said the Conservative party “believes the British public now have no right to expect honest politicians”, while Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said Tory MPs have “narrowly voted to keep a lawbreaker and liar in No 10”.\n\nThe confidence vote was triggered early on Monday morning after more than 54 Tory MPs – 15% of the total – submitted no-confidence letters to Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee that represents backbenchers.\n\nJohnson had embarked on a last-minute bid to win over colleagues but a number of Tory MPs said they were surprised by the lack of effort put into the operation.\n\nThe rebels started the day thinking Johnson was certain to win the vote convincingly but became increasingly emboldened after the resignation of John Penrose as No 10’s anti-corruption tsar and a critical statement from Jeremy Hunt, a possible leadership contender.\n\n“Anyone who believes our country is stronger, fairer and more prosperous when led by Conservatives should reflect that the consequence of not changing will be to hand the country to others who do not share those values. Today’s decision is change or lose. I will be voting for change,” Hunt said.\n\nAnnouncing he would quit, Penrose called on Johnson to stand down too, accusing the prime minister of failing to address the “broader and very serious criticisms” contained in Sue Gray’s report into Downing Street parties.\n\nHe said the only fair conclusion to draw from Gray’s report was “that you have breached a fundamental principle of the ministerial code – a clear resigning matter”.\n\nJesse Norman, a former Treasury minister, also published an excoriating letter saying Johnson had “presided over a culture of casual law-breaking at 10 Downing Street in relation to Covid”. For Johnson to describe himself as vindicated by last month’s Gray report was “grotesque”, he said, adding that breaching the Northern Ireland protocol would be “foolhardy and almost certainly illegal”, while the policy of deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda policy was “ugly”.\n\nA string of Scottish Tory MPs, including leader Douglas Ross and John Lamont, who resigned as a ministerial aide, also said they voted against Johnson.\n\nSome MPs hardened their resolve against the prime minister after he gave a defiant speech to the 1922 Committee late on Monday afternoon, suggesting he would take the same decision again in relation to holding leaving dos in No 10 during lockdown.\n\nHe also blamed the “media-driven focus on the leadership of the Conservative party” and tried to turn the debate on to Brexit by claiming a vote against him would lead to a “hellish groundhog day” about rejoining the EU single market.\n\n“Let us refuse to dance to the tune of the media, let us refuse to gratify our opponents by turning in on ourselves,” he said. “Let’s show this country that we understand that this is a moment to unite and serve. If we can do that then believe you me, whatever they may say about me I will lead you to victory again and the winners will be the people of this country.”\n\nAfter the meeting, a Tory source briefing in support of the prime minister also played down the significance of the Partygate furore that has enraged the public. “Is there anyone here who hasn’t got pissed in their lives? Is there anyone here who doesn’t like a glass of wine to decompress?” they said.\n\nBut one of the first MPs to leave the meeting, arch Brexiter Steve Baker, took a very different view. He told reporters that it was “a very, very sad day” but he felt he had no choice but to vote against the prime minister.\n\n“For me, although this is an incredibly difficult moment, I can’t move past the requirement to have at the very top of government a culture of compliance with laws,” he said. “I told the prime minister that if he broke the law he’d have to go, he clearly broke the law, he has clearly acquiesced in the law being broken, and so I must keep my word.”", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/boris-johnson-survives-for-now", "title": "Boris Johnson Survives, for Now | The New Yorker", "text": "Since Boris Johnson became Britain’s Prime Minister, in July, 2019, comparisons between him and Donald Trump have perhaps been overdone a bit. But the two of them undoubtedly share one trait: wanton shamelessness. So, on Monday evening, when Johnson addressed a group of Conservative Members of Parliament, shortly before a vote of confidence in his Party leadership, there was never any prospect of him sincerely fessing up to his transgressions.\n\nThe vote was sparked by revelations about how, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, Johnson and his staff repeatedly flouted strict social-distancing regulations that they had ordered their fellow-citizens to observe. An independent report published last month detailed a number of social events at 10 Downing Street during which staffers partied late into the night, drinking heavily, and, in at least one instance, belting out karaoke.\n\nWithout naming Johnson specifically, the author of the report, Sue Gray, a senior civil servant, pointed to serious “failures of leadership and judgment in No 10 and the Cabinet Office.” The evidence that Gray gathered indicated that Johnson misled Parliament when he claimed not to know about illicit social gatherings in his office or residence, and also when he said that he was sure no lockdown rules had been breached. A photograph from November, 2020, during the deadly second wave of the coronavirus, showed Johnson standing in a room at 10 Downing Street, surrounded by other people and bottles of alcohol, raising a glass to a departing colleague.\n\nAt the meeting of Tory M.P.s on Monday evening, Johnson skated around these damaging details. According to accounts from journalists, he reminded his audience of the big election victory that he had led the Party to, in 2019, and of the fact that he had, as he saw it, resolved the long-running Brexit crisis by finally withdrawing Britain from the E.U. Then he asked, “Do you really think that anyone else would have done it?” At least one of the M.P.s present asked him about the conduct detailed in the Gray report, to which he apparently replied, “I’d do it again.” Shortly after the meeting ended, an unnamed Conservative Party source told reporters that the British public didn’t care about the COVID infractions, adding, “Is there anyone here who hasn’t got pissed in their lives? Is there anyone here who doesn’t like a glass of wine to decompress?”\n\nWhen the Conservatives’ votes were tallied, later that night, they showed that two hundred and eleven M.P.s had supported Johnson and a hundred and forty-eight had expressed no confidence in him. If Johnson had lost the vote, he would, almost certainly, have been forced to resign. The Prime Minister survived, but more than forty per cent of his own party had abandoned him. After the outcome was announced, Johnson brazenly hailed it as “a convincing result, a decisive result.” The headline in the Financial Times was closer to the truth: “Weakened Boris Johnson Scrapes Through After Damaging Confidence Vote.”\n\nJohnson received a lower share of Conservative M.P.s’ votes than his Tory predecessor, Theresa May, garnered in a 2018 no-confidence vote, which was followed, six months later, by her resignation. The current situation isn’t directly comparable because May, after her vote, was still burdened by the ongoing Brexit stalemate, whereas the COVID restrictions are now in the past. But many observers, including a number of Conservatives, think that the Good Ship Boris has been holed below the waterline. “This is the end for Boris Johnson. The only question is how long the agony is prolonged,” Rory Stewart, a former Conservative minister who now teaches at Yale, tweeted.\n\nIf Stewart is proved correct, Partygate won’t be the only thing that did in Johnson, although the scandal has certainly turned many ordinary voters against him, and particularly against his clumsy efforts to cover up the high jinks at No. 10. “In terms of partying, it wasn’t a mad party, though they were drinking and mixing when we weren’t,” Barbara Robinson, a retired pharmaceutical analyst who lives in Bury, a post-industrial town near Manchester, told the Guardian. “But to lie about it consistently and to lie in the House of Commons, that’s the problem.”\n\nThe larger case against Johnson is that his flouting of COVID restrictions is one aspect of a broad dereliction of duty that has alienated a wide range of Conservatives—from centrists to free-market Thatcherites, to even some of his former Brexit allies. Critics from Johnson’s own party have declared his government rudderless. “We have a grotesque goof clowning around as if he cannot wait to get back to the latest party in No.10,” Bruce Anderson, a veteran conservative commentator, wrote, on the eve of the no-confidence vote.\n\nEven more damning was a lengthy public letter to Johnson issued by Jesse Norman, a Conservative M.P. and former minister who had supported the Prime Minister for fifteen years, first for the London mayoralty and then for his current post. “Under you the Government seems to lack a sense of mission,” Norman wrote. “It has a large majority, but no long-term plan. . . . Rather, you are simply seeking to campaign, to keep changing the subject and to create political and cultural dividing lines mainly for your advantage.” Norman added, “You are apparently trying to import elements of a presidential system of government that is entirely foreign to our constitution and law. But you are not a president, and you have no mandate other than as an MP, and from the confidence of your colleagues.”\n\nThe latter reference was to Johnson’s Trump-like attempts to centralize power in his own office, neutering his Cabinet as well as Parliament itself. In theory, this threatens the British system of government. But another thing Johnson shares with Trump is that his pretensions of power greatly overshadow his willingness to do the hard work of insuring that his many edicts are actually implemented. Since the great Brexit drama, his rule has been more clown show than Il Duce revival—but also has done genuine damage. Lately, Johnson has displayed a willingness to undermine parts of the 1998 Anglo-Irish peace agreement, and he has introduced some divisive and nasty efforts to shore up the Tory base by banning noisy protests and deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda, regardless of where they came from.\n\nHow much longer will Johnson last in Downing Street? Under the current Conservative Party rules, his leadership can’t be challenged again for at least twelve months. In addition, the next general election doesn’t have to be held until January, 2025, so the Prime Minister potentially has time to rebuild his standing. Even now, his raw political instincts—as opposed to his governing abilities—shouldn’t be underestimated. By shifting the Tories further rightward on social issues and leftward on economics, he is pursuing a populist strategy that is designed to splinter the opposition Labour Party’s traditional working-class base. Just a couple of weeks ago, Johnson’s government displayed its willingness to veer away from standard conservative policies by imposing a windfall tax on the pandemic-driven profits of oil companies—a proposal that, so far, has proved too bold for the Biden Administration to endorse.\n\nLike Trump, Johnson is too self-focussed and slippery to be confined within a single political philosophy, and, like Trump, he blames the media for his troubles. But it wasn’t journalists who booed him outside St. Paul’s Cathedral, on Friday, when he arrived at a service to celebrate Queen Elizabeth’s Platinum Jubilee; and it wasn’t journalists who urged their Conservative M.P.s to cast votes against him in Monday’s vote. It was ordinary people from many different parts of Britain. Before Monday’s vote, Douglas Ross, an M.P. who leads the Scottish Conservatives and represents a parliamentary constituency in the largely rural Highlands and Islands region, issued a public statement. “Having listened closely to people in Moray who re-elected me to represent them,” he said, “I cannot in good faith support Boris Johnson.” Who could?", "authors": ["Condé Nast", "John Cassidy"], "publish_date": "2022/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-61717032", "title": "Boris Johnson: What threats does he now face to his job?"}, {"url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00344893.2024.2365676", "title": "The Downfall of Boris Johnson: Analysing Patterns of Opinion ..."}, {"url": "https://theweek.com/news/uk-news/953564/boris-johnson-timeline-prime-minister-highs-and-lows", "title": "The highs and lows of Boris Johnson's time as prime minister | The ...", "text": "Boris Johnson’s controversial premiership comes to an end today after Liz Truss was chosen to replace him as party leader and prime minister.\n\nLess than three years after leading the Conservatives to their biggest election victory in 30 years, the former mayor of London announced he was stepping down in July after the mass resignation of ministers made his position untenable.\n\nIn his last article as PM, published in the Sunday Express last weekend, Johnson said the brutal mud-slinging that has marred the Tory leadership race must stop for the good of party and country.

Here are the highs and lows of his tumultuous premiership:\n\n24 July 2019: Johnson assumes office\n\nAfter becoming prime minister just over three years ago, Johnson promised to defy “the doubters, the doomsters and the gloomsters” by delivering Brexit within 99 days.\n\nIn a speech outside 10 Downing Street that was “infused with patriotic pronouncements”, said The Guardian, Johnson declared that “people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts”. Following three years of “unfounded self-doubt”, the PM said, it was “time to change the record”.\n\nBrexit “broke” Theresa May, wrote Alan McGuinness for Sky News, but Johnson’s “unique blend of rhetoric and optimism” was “the perfect tonic for a party that wants to feel good about itself again”.\n\n3 September 2019: he loses his majority\n\nJohnson faced a major showdown with his own MPs as they sought to block the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe “opening gambit” in an “acrimonious” debate was the defection of Phillip Lee, a Conservative MP who crossed the floor to join the benches of the Liberal Democrats as the prime minister addressed the Commons, reported Politico. He accused the government of using “political manipulation, bullying and lies” to push through its plans on Brexit.\n\nJohnson later removed the whip from 21 rebel Tories for voting against the government. The rebels included Ken Clarke, an MP since 1970, and Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill.\n\n13 December 2019: a general election victory\n\nAfter forcing an election over the Commons stalemate on Brexit, Johnson secured a “crushing victory” as voters backed his pledge to “get Brexit done”, reported The Guardian.\n\nThe Conservatives won 364 of the 650 seats up for grabs, in what the paper noted was “the party’s best showing in a parliamentary election since Margaret Thatcher triumphed in 1987”.\n\nEqually “astonishing” were the crushing defeats in the historic Labour heartlands, said the BBC’s political correspondent Nick Eardley. “Labour, by contrast, could hardly be in a worse position,” Eardley wrote.\n\n7 April 2020: Johnson is admitted to intensive care with Covid-19\n\nJust four months after his election victory high, in what The New York Times described as a “cruel reversal” of fortunes, the PM was admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 – the first major world leader reported to have contracted the virus.\n\nThe then foreign secretary Dominic Raab deputised throughout Johnson’s illness, which briefly “plunged the country back into the uncertainty Britons thought they had left behind” after so recently emerging from the “paralysis and polarisation” of Brexit, said the paper.\n\nIn an interview with The Sun on Sunday, the PM later revealed that he needed “litres and litres” of oxygen during his three-day stay in St Thomas’ intensive care unit in London, and that it was “50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe”.\n\n13 November 2020: Dominic Cummings resigns\n\nDominic Cummings “was seen leaving No. 10 a short while ago carrying a box”, reported the BBC, as Johnson’s closest adviser and key ally quit following a dispute that also triggered the resignation of communications director Lee Cain.\n\nTheir departures would “mark the end of the Vote Leave clique’s iron grip on government”, said the Daily Mail. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg described Cummings’ exit as “a political explosion”.\n\nAlthough Cummings would frame his departure as part of a long-term master plan, insiders told the BBC’s political editor that he “jumped because otherwise he would be pushed soon”. Johnson had recently come to see that his former aide’s band of “Brexit Boys” were just “in it for themselves”, the source claimed.\n\n8 December 2020: vaccination programme begins to roll out\n\nOne of the biggest successes for Johnson and his government was the UK’s Covid-19 vaccination programme. Indeed, “Britain soared ahead of every comparable country in the weeks after the vaccines became available, with the one exception being Israel”, said Hugo Gye of the i news site.\n\nBut criticism was not far behind. “Global leadership is an unaccustomed status for a country with one of the highest rates of excess deaths in western Europe,” said the Financial Times. “Multiple missteps”, such as the much-maligned NHS Track and Trace system, meant that “cynicism” remained over the government’s handling of the pandemic, the paper reported.\n\n21 December 2020: Christmas is ‘cancelled’\n\nThe hopes of a Christmas with loved ones were “dashed” for almost 20 million people after Johnson placed London and large parts of the southeast under “draconian” Tier-4 coronavirus restrictions, said PoliticsHome.\n\nJohnson had previously promised that Britons would be allowed to form “bubbles” with two other households over the Christmas period.\n\n“I want to be clear, we don’t want to ban Christmas,” Johnson told a press conference on 16 December. “And I think that would be frankly inhuman and against the instincts of many people in this country.”\n\nBut a few days later, families were told they could not mix after all.\n\n29 May 2021: Johnson marries fiancée Carrie Symonds\n\nAfter a turbulent year, Johnson married Carrie Symonds in a secretly planned Catholic ceremony at Westminster Cathedral.\n\nOnly 30 people attended the Covid-compliant wedding, as Johnson became the first PM to marry in office for “nearly 200 years”, the BBC reported.\n\nSome “disgruntled” congregants questioned how “the twice-divorced prime minister was able to marry in a Catholic church”, said The Telegraph.\n\n19 July 2021: England’s ‘Freedom Day’\n\nAs England prepared for all social distancing rules to be lifted on what some newspapers dubbed “Freedom Day”, both Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were accused of trying to “dodge” self-isolation rules, after being in close contact with health secretary Sajid Javid, who had tested positive for coronavirus, reported the BBC.\n\nNo. 10 initially said that Johnson and Sunak would not isolate as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involved daily testing. But the duo were forced to “perform a full reversal little more than two-and-a-half hours” later, amid widespread anger as opposition parties suggested there was “one rule for them and one for the rest of us”, reported Sky News.\n\n30 November 2021: Partygate allegations\n\nThe first allegations that Boris Johnson and Downing Street staff might have broken the government’s own Covid rules by holding parties and events during the 2020 Christmas holidays were reported by the Mirror.\n\nThe paper said that at least two parties had taken place. The PM was reported to have given a speech at a “packed leaving do” for a senior aide. And at a second event, while the rest of the country was locked down at home, officials were said to have “knocked back glasses of wine during a Christmas quiz and a Secret Santa”.\n\nDowning Street did not deny that the events had taken place, but a spokesperson insisted that “Covid rules have been followed at all times”.\n\nHowever, in a hint that further damaging revelations were to follow, a source told the Mirror that there had been “many social gatherings” in Downing Street over the holiday season.\n\n25 January 2022: Scotland Yard launches probe\n\nThe Metropolitan Police launched an official investigation into alleged Covid rule-breaking by lawmakers and officials, following a string of damaging revelations in the press and an internal government investigation conducted by top civil servant Sue Gray.\n\nNamed Operation Hillman, the police probe focused on 12 alleged incidents on eight dates between May 2020 and April 2021, and examined more than 500 documents and 300 photographs gathered by the Gray investigation.\n\nThe force sent more than 100 questionnaires to those suspected of attending parties at Downing Street and Whitehall, including Johnson, that asked for “an account and explanation of the recipient’s participation”. According to the Mirror, Johnson was thought to have attended at least seven of the parties investigated by the Met.\n\n9 April 2022: Johnson visits Ukraine\n\nIn what No. 10 called a “show of solidarity” with Ukraine amid the Russian invasion, Johnson made an unannounced visit to Kyiv for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nJohnson paid tribute to “Zelenskyy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people”, adding that “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv”.\n\n“I made clear today that the United Kingdom stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight, and we are in it for the long run,” the PM said. “We are stepping up our own military and economic support and convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end, and ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation.”\n\nJohnson pledged new lethal aid to Ukraine in the form of “120 armoured vehicles and anti-ship missile systems”, as well as further economic support for the embattled nation, “taking total UK loan guarantees to £770m”, the BBC reported.\n\nIn a televised statement, he said that Ukrainians had shown “the courage of a lion” and that their president had “given the roar of that lion”.\n\n12 April 2022: fined over lockdown parties\n\nJohnson became “the first sitting prime minister to be criminally sanctioned” after the Met issued him with a £50 fixed penalty notice for attending a party for his birthday at No. 10 in June 2020, reported The Guardian.\n\nHis wife was also fined for attending the surprise birthday party, as was Rishi Sunak.\n\nAfter Gray’s long-awaited report was published in May, pressure from within the Conservative Party grew on Johnson, with a “drip feed of no confidence letters” being sent to Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 committee, along with senior Tory MPs publicly calling for the PM to go.\n\n“Veteran Tory” Bob Neill, chairman of the Commons Justice Committee, added his name to that list, “saying he did not regard the PM’s explanations as ‘credible’”, reported Sky News.\n\n6 June 2022: narrowly wins confidence vote\n\nMounting dissatisfaction with Johnson finally boiled over in June when the necessary threshold of Tory MPs submitted letters to the 1922 committee withdrawing their support for the prime minister, triggering a confidence vote.\n\nIn the end, a majority of Tory MPs backed the prime minister. But the margin of victory – 211 votes for to 148 against – was much closer than many had expected.\n\nDespite Johnson describing the vote win as “decisive” and “an opportunity to put behind us all the stuff that the media goes on about”, the BBC said: “The scale of the rebellion against him showed his authority had been weakened.”\n\nNoting the vote share in support of Johnson was lower than the 63% received by former prime minister Theresa May when she won a party confidence vote in 2018 before resigning six months later over a Brexit deadlock, the BBC’s political editor Chris Mason said: “The simple truth is when more than four in ten of your own MPs think the country would be better off without you, you have a problem.”\n\nNevertheless, under existing Tory party rules, the win meant Johnson was immune from a Conservative leadership challenge for a year.\n\n15 June 2022: ethics adviser quits\n\nA week after the confidence vote, Lord Geidt, Johnson’s ethics adviser, quit, saying he had been put in an “impossible and odious position”.\n\nGeidt had threatened to quit the previous month after concluding that there were “legitimate” questions about whether the prime minister broke the ministerial code over the lockdown parties scandal in Downing Street.\n\n30 June: the Chris Pincher affair\n\nWhat started off as a sexual harassment story featuring yet another Tory MP in the end proved to be the final nail in the coffin of Johnson’s political career.\n\nChris Pincher, the MP for Tamworth and the deputy chief whip, resigned from the government on 1 July and was suspended from the Conservative Party a day later in the wake of allegations that he groped two men in the private members’ Carlton Club.\n\nYet as more historic allegations emerged, Johnson was accused of ignoring warnings of inappropriate behaviour by Pincher before appointing him to the role of deputy chief whip in February 2022.\n\n“Under mounting pressure to reveal what he knew” before appointing him to the whips’ office, which oversees discipline within the party, Johnson and his aides repeatedly obfuscated and changed their story, said the BBC.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News’ Kay Burley, education minister Will Quince said he had been given “categorical assurance” from No. 10 that Johnson was “not aware of any serious specific allegations” against Pincher when he was appointed. But within hours, the prime minister’s official spokesman admitted that Johnson had been “aware of media reports that others had seen over the years”.\n\nIn an attempt to put an end to the growing furore Johnson issued a full apology in an interview with the BBC’s Chris Mason but it was too late, with senior cabinet ministers Javid and Sunak announcing their resignations as the interview aired.\n\n7 July: he announces his resignation\n\nJavid’s decision to quit as health secretary on 5 July triggered the deluge of resignations that ultimately toppled Johnson.\n\nIn a seismic 48 hours in Westminster, more than 50 ministers followed Javid in protest at Johnson’s decision to remain in Downing Street.\n\nHaving initially sought to stem the tide by quickly appointing replacements to the cabinet, by the morning of 7 July the game was up after it became clear he had lost the support of almost all his MPs and a flurry of junior ministerial resignations left his government struggling to function.\n\nAnnouncing his resignation outside No. 10 surrounded by his family and closest aides, Johnson delivered what politics lecturer Paula Keaveney described on The Conversation as “a bitter resignation speech” that “was followed by objections over its tone and led to calls for him to depart straight away rather than staying on until his successor is appointed”.\n\n6 September: he finally stands down as PM\n\nHaving taken the dramatic step of calling – and winning - a confidence vote in his own government in the days after his resignation announcement Johnson was able to stay on in No. 10 while a new leader was chosen.\n\nDespite the UK being in the grips of a cost-of-living crisis, the outgoing prime minister was accused of shirking his responsibilities and leading a “zombie government” by his critics, a view not helped by his decision to take numerous holidays abroad over the summer.\n\nHe departed Downing Street with the threat of an ongoing Commons inquiry into whether he deliberately misled Parliament still hanging over him.\n\nYet even with the threat of losing his Uxbridge seat and the unceremonious way he was thrown out by his own MPs, many, including perhaps Johnson himself, see this not as the end but merely a prelude to a second act.\n\n“When it comes to Johnson’s numerous misdemeanours, Conservatives seem eager to forgive and forget as soon as possible, with many not seeming to think there is anything to forgive,” said Prospect.\n\nJohnson suggested as much with his final PMQs, signing off with the phrase “Hasta la vista, baby”.\n\nGiven his extraordinary political career it would be foolish to write off such a dramatic return completely.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "The Week Uk", "Sorcha Bradley", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Harriet Marsden", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/07/23"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiership_of_Boris_Johnson", "title": "Premiership of Boris Johnson - Wikipedia"}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1cy6u8h/whats_up_with_the_uk_right_now_why_another/", "title": "What's up with the UK right now?

After his libel trial against Heard was concluded, legendary guitarist Jeff Beck announced that Depp would appear with him on a forthcoming album.\n\nDepp has also launched a new TikTok account, @JohnnyDepp, which has already amassed some 3.6 million followers, despite the fact he is yet to post a single video.\n\nOn Thursday, Depp appeared on stage in Gateshead on the latest leg of Beck’s UK tour, “to the delight of hundreds of fans”, as well as joining him at the Royal Albert Hall last week, said the BBC. He is also expected to make an appearance in York this evening as the musician continues his tour.\n\nAnd Depp also joined Beck – along with a 20-person entourage – for an extravagant night at a fine dining Indian restaurant in Birmingham on Sunday. The film star reportedly splashed out some £50,000 for a three-course meal of “shish kebabs, chicken tikka and tandoori king prawns”, said the Evening Standard.\n\nWhat next for #MeToo?\n\nCritics have said the outcome of Depp’s trial is likely to have a damaging effect on victims of domestic violence who want to come forward and report their experience.\n\nAs Constance Grady wrote for Vox, Depp brought a libel case against Heard for a newspaper article she wrote that did not name Depp, but in which she referred to herself as “a public figure representing domestic abuse”.\n\nThe outcome of the trial, which found that Depp had been defamed, “is as much as to say that anyone who says the phrase ‘I was abused’ can be sued as a liar”, said Grady. This, she argued, is “highly likely to have a chilling effect” on domestic abuse victims coming forward.\n\nBut Tarana Burke, an activist who founded the #MeToo movement, said the trial’s verdict would not end or damage the movement.\n\n“The ‘me too’ movement isn’t dead, this system is dead,” Burke wrote on Twitter. “This is the same legal system that y’all have been relying on for justice and accountability for decades to no avail. When you get the verdict you want, ‘the movement works’ – when you don’t, it’s dead.”\n\nShe added: “When [Harvey] Weinstein went to jail it was, ‘me too is winning!’ When [Bill] Cosby came home it was ‘What a blow, me too is losing!”\n\nBurke wrote that #MeToo had helped survivors of domestic abuse come forward, saying “millions of people who have never been able to utter the words ‘it happened to me’ have released the shame that wasn’t theirs to carry in the first place.\n\n“This movement is very much ALIVE,” she said.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Us", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "Julia O'Driscoll", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-61679022", "title": "Johnny Depp gigs in Gateshead after Amber Heard libel case win"}, {"url": "https://deadline.com/2022/05/johnny-depp-jeff-beck-performance-england-1235035309/", "title": "Johnny Depp Joins Jeff Beck Onstage For Second Night In A Row ...", "text": "UPDATED: Just days after testifying on his behalf in Johnny Depp‘s acrimonious $50 million defamation suit against Amber Heard, Kate Moss joined her ex-boyfriend as he jammed with Jeff Beck for a third night in a row on the guitar legend’s European tour.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Moss attended Tuesday’s show to see her ex and Beck perform at Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nSix days before, she gave very brief testimony via video, refuting a rumored allegation that the actor pushed her down a flight of stairs when they dated in the 1990s.\n\n“He never pushed me, kicked me or threw me down any kind of stairs,” Moss said, testifying it was she who slipped and it was Depp who carried her back to the room and got her medical attention.\n\nPREVIOUSLY on May 30: One night after making a surprise appearance during guitar legend Jeff Beck’s show in Sheffield, England, Johnny Depp joined Beck onstage again Sunday, this time at London’s iconic Royal Albert Hall.\n\n“He came knocking on my dressing room door about five years ago and we haven’t stopped laughing since,” the onetime Yardbirds guitarist said by way of introduction as some expectant fans called out “Johnny!”\n\n“We kept it quiet for obvious reasons,” said Beck, “but here he is.”\n\nJeff Beck introducing Johnny Depp at the Royal Albert Hall ♥️ “He came knocking on my dressing room door about five years ago and we haven’t stopped laughing since” pic.twitter.com/JhHAMvAEcR — 🌟🏴‍☠️ (@GellertDepp) May 30, 2022\n\nThe duo again played their 2020 collaboration “Isolation,” a remake of the song John Lennon released in 1970.\n\nBeck has one more show in London on Monday night.

The pair also performed covers of Marvin Gay’s “What’s Going On” and Jimi Hendrix’s “Little Wing.” There’s speculation Depp may also join Beck on his next two tour stops at London’s Royal Albert Hall on May 30 and 31.\n\nDepp fans erupted with joy on social media seeing the passionate performers together again, as well as his newly dyed hair that’s much lighter than what he wore during his court appearances.\n\nBefore becoming an actor, Depp began his career as a musician. He formed the supergroup Hollywood Vampires with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry in 2015.\n\nDepp is currently on a break from his high-profile court case against his ex-wife Amber Heard which is nearing its conclusion as the jury deliberates.

apart from junior doctors with the British Medical Association (BMA) - paused any further action after the majority said they would put a new offer to their members.\n\nJunior doctors\n\nJunior doctors who are members of the BMA walked out for 72 hours from 13-15 March.\n\nMore than 98% of junior doctors who took part in a ballot earlier in 2023 voted to strike, with the BMA recording a record turnout of 77.5%.\n\nTalks between the BMA and Health Secretary Steve Barclay at the start of March did not improve matters.\n\nThe union said the secretary of state \"refused to come forth with any improved offer\".\n\nThe government said on 16 March it had offered junior doctors the same terms as other NHS unions, who are putting the offer to their members, but their request for a \"pay rise of 35% is not affordable\".\n\nOn 23 March it was confirmed that junior doctors would walk out again for four days in April, from 06.59 on Tuesday 11 April to 06.59 on Saturday 15 April.\n\nNHS leaders have warned that the 96-hour walkout could lead to up to a quarter of a million appointments and operations being postponed.\n\nAmbulance staff\n\nPaused: 20 March - National strikes by Unite members\n\nThe regions that could still be affected are:\n\n• West Midlands\n\n• North East\n\n• East Midlands\n\n• North West\n\nAmbulance workers at Unison and GMB called off their March strike dates in England in order to enter talks with the government.\n\nFollowing the talks, GMB, Unison and Unite are putting a government offer to their members involving a one-off payment of 2% of their salary plus an additional COVID recovery bonus of 4% for the 2022/23 financial year and a 5% pay increase for 2023/24.\n\nUnite, which represents fewer ambulance workers, said while it will put the offer to members, it will not recommend they accept it, unlike GMB and Unison.\n\nAfter the proposed March strike dates were called off, Rachel Harrison, GMB national secretary, said: \"GMB ambulance workers announced a tightening of the derogations for cover on strike days.\n\n\"Less than 24 hours later we received a letter from the Secretary of State for Health, Steve Barclay, inviting us and other unions to pay talks.\n\n\"This is a huge shift from the government, who for months have refused to consider negotiations on pay.\"\n\nAbout 25,000 paramedics, emergency care assistants, ambulance technicians, call handlers and other 999 crew members from the Unison, GMB and Unite unions walked out across England and Wales in December.\n\nMembers were striking over pay, patient safety and staffing levels, with unions saying staff shortages are crippling services every day, putting patients at risk due to the government's failure to invest in growing demand.\n\nGMB and Unite members in Wales suspended their strike on 6 February after receiving a new pay offer from the Welsh government.\n\nImage: Members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) on the picket line outside the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham\n\nNurses\n\nNurses went on strike on the 6 and 7 of February, which followed their first-ever strikes in December and then January, with the Royal College of Nursing warning action will continue until the government listens to their demands.\n\nThe RCN had announced that its members would stage a continuous 48-hour strike from 6am on 1 March, with no services exempt.\n\nAnd it would for the first time involve nursing staff working in emergency departments, intensive care units, cancer care and other services that previously did not take part.\n\nHowever, a joint statement from the RCN and the Department of Health and Social Care revealed they would be pausing the strikes while fresh talks went ahead.\n\nUnison also paused strike action due for 8 March to enter talks with the government.\n\nOn 16 March, following talks with the government both the RCN and Unison said it would put a new offer to its members and will recommend they accept it.\n\nThe offer involves a one-off payment of 2% of their salary for the 2022/23 financial year plus a COVID recovery bonus of 4%, and a 5% pay increase for 2023/24.\n\nMr Barclay said a newly qualified nurse will get more than £1,800 this year on top of a pay rise of more than £1,300 next year.\n\nMembers of the RCN originally called for a pay rise of 5% above inflation - 19.2% - as they claim they have had a real terms pay cut of 20% since 2010.\n\nThey also want better working conditions as nursing vacancies are at a record high, saying this means staff are stretched and regularly working beyond their shifts without extra pay.\n\nIn Wales, the union has cancelled the planned strikes after receiving a new pay offer from the Welsh government.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:44 A 10% pay rise for NHS nurses is 'not affordable', says the health secretary.\n\nPhysiotherapists\n\nPhysiotherapists from the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) went on strike on 26 January and 9 February.\n\nMore than 4,000 physiotherapists employed by 30 NHS trusts across England are thought to have taken part.\n\nThe CSP had been due to walk out on 22 March - but suspended action in order to enter talks with the government with other health unions.\n\nIt will put a new pay offer from the government to its members - a one-off payment of 2% of their salary for the 2022/23 financial year plus a COVID recovery bonus of 4%, and a 5% pay increase for 2023/24.\n\nRail\n\nLondon Underground drivers, represented by Aslef, and other tube workers, represented by the RMT, went on strike on 15 March - the day chancellor Jeremy Hunt delivered his budget - in a dispute over pensions, job losses and working arrangements.\n\nRMT members at 14 train companies took part in the first in a wave of four 24-hour on 16 March and 18 March, but suspended plans for rail strikes on 30 March and 1 April.\n\nIt came after the RMT announced on Monday that union members at Network Rail had voted to accept a revised pay offer in a similar dispute.\n\nIn a statement, the union said: \"Following further talks between RMT and the Rail Delivery Group [RDG] today, a proposal was tabled by the RDG which could lead to a resolution to resolve the current national rail dispute through a new offer.\n\n\"The National Executive Committee has therefore suspended strike action scheduled for 30 March and 1 April.\"\n\nTrain operators have offered staff a pay rise worth 9% over two years, with a guarantee against compulsory redundancies until the end of 2024.\n\nCivil servants\n\nA fresh round of civil service strikes will continue into April in the ongoing dispute over pay and conditions - showing that the government cannot rest easy yet.\n\nThe general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, Mark Serwotka, said his members \"are not backing down\", with numerous actions planned for the month - including an \"all out\" strike day on 28 April, which will see 133,000 members on the picket line.\n\nThe move, agreed by the union's executive committee, means there will be strike action in different parts of the civil service from 27 March until the end of April - including passport workers, who are walking out for five weeks until 6 May.\n\nThe newest action will come from Ofgem workers based in Canary Wharf and Glasgow, who will go on strike for six days from 10 April, and on 17 April.\n\nAbout 133,000 civil servants from the PCS union went on strike on budget day, on 15 March, in an escalation of a dispute over pay, pensions and job security.\n\nDriving test examiners also announced 10 strike days taking place between 6 and 28 March in a dispute over pay, pensions and jobs. More than 1,600 members of the PCS employed by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency will take rolling days of industrial action.\n\nIt follows another mass strike on 1 February that saw hundreds of thousands of members in 123 government departments walk out across England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nPrevious action has involved Border Force staff and National Highways workers - but the PCS is balloting another 30,000 members working for 10 more employers, including HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the Welsh government, with the results expected at the end of the month.\n\nThe PCS union is calling for a 10% pay rise, protections to pensions and protections from job cuts.\n\nThe government has said the demands - which it says would cost £2.4bn - are unaffordable.\n\nPassport Office\n\nPassport Office staff in Durham, Glasgow, Liverpool, Newport, Peterborough and Southport will take industrial action from 3 April to 5 May.\n\nIt will be accompanied by similar action by staff in Belfast from 7 April to 5 May.\n\nMembers of the PCS union will walk out for five weeks across England, Scotland and Wales while those in Northern Ireland will strike for four weeks.\n\nThe union said the action is a \"significant escalation\" in the long-running dispute as it warned the strike will have a \"significant impact\" on the delivery of passports as summer approaches.\n\nMembers are asking for a 10% pay rise as well as job security, changes to their pensions and protected redundancy terms.\n\nOn 1 February, Passport Office staff joined about 100,000 civil servants represented by the PCS as part of industrial action affecting 124 government departments.\n\nAbout 133,000 civil servants also walked out on 15 March in the largest day of strikes since this current wave started last year.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:48 Teachers 'have nothing left'\n\nTeachers\n\nThe National Education Union (NEU) took part in three days of consecutive strikes between 28 February and 2 March, and 15-16 March across England and Wales.\n\nThousands of teachers across England and Wales also went on strike on 1 February after the largest education union reached the threshold required to take industrial action.\n\nThe NEU organised a ballot of 300,000 members, calling for a \"fully funded, above-inflation pay rise\".\n\nOn 17 March, the NEU, National Association of Headteachers (NAHT), NASUWT The Teachers' Union, and Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) announced they would be entering \"intensive talks\" in a joint statement with the government.\n\nAs part of the negotiations, the unions agreed to not announce any more strikes for a fortnight.\n\nOn 27 March the NEU broke cover to say it would tell its members to reject the offer put forward by the government, which it branded \"insulting\".\n\nThe Department for Education (DfE) said it had \"put forward a fair and reasonable offer\", with an average 4.5% pay rise for next year and a £1,000 one-off payment for this year, as well as a commitment to \"reduce workload by five hours each week\".\n\nBut while the government claims the rise is fully funded, the union said up to 58% of schools would have to make cuts next year to afford it.\n\nThe NEU has opened a ballot so members can vote on the offer, but called it \"insulting\", saying the government \"simply does not value teachers\".\n\nOn days of action, some schools have been closed entirely while others were not impacted.\n\nA planned strike by teachers belonging to the National Education Union due to be held in Wales on 14 February was postponed after a new pay offer was received but the NEU rejected the offer so is striking in March instead.\n\nScottish teachers\n\nRolling strikes were set to take place for much of March and into April across schools in Scotland.\n\nBut the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) called this off on 3 March, when they recommended members accept a revised pay offer from the Scottish government.\n\nImage: Members of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) join teachers at a rally outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh in a protest over pay\n\nUniversity staff\n\nMore than 70,000 staff at 150 universities will strike on several days throughout March after already walking out in February.\n\nThe UCU is in dispute with those universities over the pay, pensions and working conditions.\n\nIt wants a higher pay offer than the 4% to 5% put on the table as well as a reversal of the cuts to pensions that will see the average member lose 35% of their guaranteed future retirement income, according to the union.\n\nThe union is also reballoting its members to take further action this academic year.\n\nAirport workers\n\nTravellers heading through the UK's busiest airport face \"severe delays\" after the more than 1,400 security staff employed by Unite announced a 10 day walk out from 31 March to 9 April.\n\nSharon Graham, the union's general secretary, said her members are \"fundamental to [the airport's] success\" and they deserve a fair pay increase.\n\nA spokesperson for Heathrow said airport has \"contingency plans\" which will \"keep the airport open and operational despite unnecessary threats of strike action by Unite\".\n\nEnvironment Agency\n\nEnvironment Agency workers who were members of Unison and Prospect went on strike between the 7 and 9 of February.\n\nThe unions say workers have had a 9% fall in pay compared with inflation since 2016 and 20% since 2010 which is causing many staff to leave.\n\nThey have rejected a 2% pay rise as \"simply not enough\".\n\nFirefighters\n\nMembers of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) overwhelmingly voted for action in a ballot that would have resulted in the UK's first nationwide fire service strike over pay since 2003.\n\nBut on 6 March, the union announced it was halting the strike, which did not yet have a date, after 96% of members who took part in a ballot voted in favour of a new pay offer negotiated with employers the month before.\n\nThey have voted to accept a 7% pay rise backdated to July 2022 and another 5% increase from July this year.\n\nThe union said they have had more than a decade of real-terms pay cuts and the new offer was a \"significant shift\" from a previous offer of just 2% - but said the backdated pay would still be a real-terms pay cut.\n\nRoyal Mail\n\nA two-day strike by postal workers planned for 16 and 17 February was called off following a legal challenge by Royal Mail.\n\nThe Communication Workers Union (CWU) blamed laws that are \"heavily weighted against working people\" for scrapping the planned walkouts.\n\nA new wave of strikes is looming after the union secured a fresh mandate for industrial action.\n\nThe CWU announced that 95.9% of its members had voted in favour of renewed strikes on a 77% turnout, although it has so far stopped short of announcing new strike dates.\n\nThe CWU has been locked in the dispute with Royal Mail since autumn with members staging 18 days of strikes in the second half of 2022 over pay, jobs and conditions.\n\nMembers have been fighting proposed modernisation plans they say would \"spell the end\" of Royal Mail and want an improved pay deal on the \"best and final\" 9% offer they rejected last year.\n\nThe dispute has become increasingly bitter and personal, with company and union leaders at each others' throats in a public battle for sympathy.", "authors": ["Sky Uk Limited"], "publish_date": "2023/08/26"}, {"url":

I was born in 1980, a year after Margaret Thatcher entered Downing Street with the prayer of St. Francis of Assisi on her lips: “Where there is doubt, may we bring faith. And where there is despair, may we bring hope.” The Conservative-run Britain of the eighties was not harmonious. Life beyond the North London square where my family lived often seemed to be in the grip of one confrontation or another. The news was always showing police on horseback. There were strikes, protests, the I.R.A., and George Michael on the radio. My father, who was a lawyer in the City, travelled to Germany to buy a Mercedes and drove it back, elated. Until Thatcher resigned, when I was ten, her steeply back-combed hair and deep, impossible voice played an outsized role in my imagination—a more interesting, more dangerous version of the Queen.\n\nI was nearly seventeen when the Tories finally lost power, to Tony Blair and “New Labour,” an updated, market-friendly version of the Party. Before he moved to Downing Street, Blair lived in Islington, the gentrifying borough I was from. Boris Johnson, an amusing right-wing columnist, who was getting his start on television, also lived nearby. Our local Member of Parliament was an out-of-touch leftist named Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nNew Labour believed in the responsibility of the state to look after its citizens, and in capitalism to make them prosper. Blair was convincing, even when he was wrong. He won three general elections in ten years and walked out of the House of Commons to a standing ovation, undefeated in his eyes. I was turning thirty when Labour eventually ran out of road, undone by the Iraq War, the global financial crisis, and the grim temper of Gordon Brown, Blair’s successor. He was caught in a hot-mike moment describing an ordinary voter, who was complaining about taxes and immigration, as a bigot.\n\nSince then, it’s been the Conservatives again. In 2010, the Party returned to government in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Since 2015, it has held power alone. Last May, the Tories surpassed the thirteen years and nine days that New Labour had held office. But the third political era of my lifetime has been nothing like the previous two. There has been no dominant figure or overt political project, no Thatcherism, no Blairism. Instead, there has been a quickening, lowering churn: five Prime Ministers, three general elections, two financial emergencies, a once-in-a-century constitutional crisis, and an atmosphere of tired, almost constant drama.\n\nThe period is bisected by the United Kingdom’s decision, in 2016, to leave the European Union, a Conservative fantasy, or nightmare, depending on whom you talk to. Brexit catalyzed some of the worst tendencies in British politics—its superficiality, nostalgia, and love of game play—and exhausted the country’s political class, leaving it ill prepared for the pandemic and the twin economic shocks of the war in Ukraine and the forty-nine-day experimental premiership of Liz Truss. Covering British politics during this period has been like trying to remember, and explain, a very convoluted and ultimately boring dream. If you really concentrate, you can recall a lot of the details, but that doesn’t lead you closer to any meaning.\n\nLast year, I started interviewing Conservatives to try to make sense of these years. “One always starts with disclaimers now—I didn’t start this car crash,” Julian Glover, a former speechwriter for David Cameron, the longest-serving Prime Minister of the period, told me. I spoke to M.P.s and former Cabinet ministers; political advisers who helped to make major decisions; and civil servants, local-government officials, and frontline workers hundreds of miles from London who had to deal with the consequences.\n\nSome people insisted that the past decade and a half of British politics resists satisfying explanation. The only way to think about it is as a psychodrama enacted, for the most part, by a small group of middle-aged men who went to élite private schools, studied at the University of Oxford, and have been climbing and chucking one another off the ladder of British public life—the cursus honorum, as Johnson once called it—ever since. The Conservative Party, whose history goes back some three hundred and fifty years, aids this theory by not having anything as vulgar as an ideology. “They’re not on a mission to do X, Y, or Z,” as a former senior adviser explained. “You win and you govern because we are better at it, right?”\n\nAnother way to think about these years is to consider them in psychological, or theoretical, terms. In “Heroic Failure,” the Irish journalist Fintan O’Toole explains Brexit by describing Britain’s fall from imperial nation to “occupied colony” of the E.U., and the rise of a powerful English nationalism as a result. Last year, Abby Innes, a scholar at the London School of Economics, published “Late Soviet Britain: Why Materialist Utopias Fail,” which argues that, since Thatcher, Britain’s political mainstream has become as devoted to particular ideas about running the state—a default commitment to competition, markets, and forms of privatization—as Brezhnev’s U.S.S.R. ever was. “The resulting regime,” Innes writes, “has proved anything but stable.”\n\nThese observations are surely right, but I worry that they obscure two basic truths about Britain’s experience since 2010. The first is that the country has suffered grievously. These have been years of loss and waste. The U.K. has yet to recover from the financial crisis that began in 2008. According to one estimate, the average worker is now fourteen thousand pounds worse off per year than if earnings had continued to rise at pre-crisis rates—it is the worst period for wage growth since the Napoleonic Wars. “Nobody who’s alive and working in the British economy today has ever seen anything like this,” Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, which published the analysis, told the BBC last year. “This is what failure looks like.”\n\nCartoon by Roz Chast Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop\n\nHigh levels of employment and immigration, coupled with the enduring dynamism of London, mask a national reality of low pay, precarious jobs, and chronic underinvestment. The trains are late. The traffic is bad. The housing market is a joke. “The core problem is easy to observe, but it’s tough to live with,” Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, told me. “It’s just not that productive an economy anymore.”\n\nWith stagnant wages, people’s living standards have fallen. In 2008, Brown’s Labour government commissioned Michael Marmot, a renowned epidemiologist, to come up with ways to reduce England’s health inequalities. Marmot made suggestions in six policy areas, including better access to child care, walking and cycling programs, social-security reforms, and measures to improve people’s sense of agency at work. In 2010, he presented his ideas to the incoming Conservative-led coalition, which accepted his findings. “I thought, Wow, this is great. . . . I was pretty bullish about the whole thing,” Marmot told me. “The problem was they then didn’t do it.”\n\nTen years later, Marmot led a follow-up study, in which he documented stalling life expectancy, particularly among women in England’s poorest communities—and widening inequalities. “For men and women everywhere the time spent in poor health is increasing,” he wrote. “This is shocking.” According to Marmot, the U.K.’s health performance since 2010, which includes rising infant mortality, slowing growth in children, and the return of rickets, makes it an outlier among comparable European nations. “The damage to the nation’s health need not have happened,” Marmot concluded in 2020. He told me, “It was a political choice.”\n\nAnd that is the second, all too obvious, fact of British life throughout this period: a single party has been responsible. You cannot say that the country has been ruled against its will. Since 2010, the Tories have emerged as the winner of the popular vote and as the largest party in Parliament in three elections. In December, 2019, Boris Johnson won an eighty-seat majority in the House of Commons, the Conservatives’ biggest electoral success since the heyday of Thatcherism.\n\nHow is this possible? The opposition has been underwhelming. For years, Labour drifted and squabbled under two unconvincing leaders: Ed Miliband and Corbyn, my old Islington M.P. It is telling that, since Labour elected Keir Starmer, an unimaginative former prosecutor with a rigidly centrist program, the Party is competitive again. But the Conservatives have not survived by default. Their party has excelled at diminishing Britain’s political landscape and shrinking the sense of what is possible. It has governed and skirmished, never settling for long. “It’s all about constantly drawing dividing lines,” a former Party strategist told me. “That’s all you need. It’s not about big ideological debates or policies or anything.” In many ways, the two momentous decisions of this period—what came to be known as austerity and Brexit—are now widely accepted as events that happened, rather than as choices that were made. Starmer’s Labour Party does not seek to reverse them.\n\nIf you live in an old country, it can be easy to succumb to a narrative of decline. The state withers. The charlatans take over. You give up on progress, to some extent, and simply pray that this particular chapter of British nonsense will come to an end. It will. Rishi Sunak, the fifth, and presumably final, Conservative Prime Minister of the era, faces an election later this year, which he will almost certainly lose. But Britain cannot move on from the Tories without properly facing up to the harm that they have caused.\n\nThe Conservative Party manifesto for the 2010 election was a plain blue hardback book titled “Invitation to Join the British Government.” After the Party’s longest spell out of power in more than a century, its pitch to voters was “the Big Society,” a call for civic volunteering and private enterprise after the statism of Labour. “There was a feeling that it must be possible to be positive about a better future in a way that wasn’t socialist,” Glover, the former speechwriter, said. “And that wasn’t an ignoble thing to try.”\n\nBeginning in 2005, Cameron and George Osborne, the shadow Chancellor, had modernized the Tories. The duo represented a new generation of Conservatives: deft and urbane, easy in their privilege. Osborne was the heir to a baronetcy; Cameron’s family descended from a mistress of William IV. Cameron embraced centrist causes, including the environment and prison reform. There was talk of a “post-bureaucratic age.” But the main aim was simpler. “Above all, it was trying to win,” Osborne told me recently.\n\nIn the spring of 2009, Cameron told a gathering of Party members in Gloucestershire, “The age of irresponsibility is giving way to the age of austerity.” The speech was part of a successful campaign to associate Labour’s public spending with the global financial crash, to which Britain had been badly exposed. “The word ‘austerity’ was deliberately introduced into the lexicon by myself and David Cameron,” Osborne said. “Austerity” evoked the country’s sober rebuilding after the Second World War. “The word didn’t have the connotations then that it does now,” Osborne recalled. “It was, you know, a bit like prudence.”\n\nIn 2010, the Conservatives fell short of a majority in the House of Commons and formed, with the Liberal Democrats, Britain’s first coalition government in almost seventy years. The state was running a deficit of a hundred and fifty-seven billion pounds—about one and a half times the budget of the National Health Service.

Her last loss came in February to 2017 Roland Garros champion Jelena Ostapenko.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSwiatek has a game that works on all surfaces, but her greatest triumphs so far have come on red clay.\n\nOn the warmest day of the tournament, the temperature was 82 degrees Fahrenheit (28 Celsius), and while the forecast predicted thunderstorms, there were just a few puffs of white in the blue sky above Court Philippe Chartrier at the outset.\n\nGauff did not get off to the best of starts, a little bit of early jitters that would be understandable coming from any player in a debut on this stage.\n\nThe player on the other side of the net certainly had a lot to do with the way things went.\n\nSwiatek broke serve right from the get-go, with plenty of help from Gauff, who put a forehand into the net, double-faulted — eliciting some sighs of \"Awwwww\" from a supportive crowd — dumped a forehand into the net, and pushed another forehand long.\n\nWhen Gauff's work-in-progress forehand betrayed her again, she got broken again to trail 3-0 after just 15 minutes of action. Soon enough, the score was 4-0 in Swiatek's favor.\n\nNot in all cases, of course, but often, the spectators at Roland Garros tend to offer their support to underdogs and to whichever player is trailing in a particular match. Both of which applied to Gauff. So there was a surfeit of shouts of \"Allez, Coco!\" There were repeated cries of her chant-ready, two-syllable first name. And one fan yelled out \"Coco, you can do it!\"\n\nWhen Gauff got on the board by holding to 4-1, the applause and roar were suitable for the capture of a set, not simply one game.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAs things appeared to be getting away from her, Gauff slapped her thigh or covered her eyes, shook her head or looked up toward her parents in the stands.\n\nWhat she never did was waver or concede anything.\n\nGauff began the second set by breaking Swiatek for the only time, and then holding to go up 2-0. Might this now be a much closer contest? Might Gauff push Swiatek to a third set?\n\nNo. Swiatek quickly recalibrated and reasserted herself, breaking back for 2-all as Gauff's propensity for miscues returned.\n\nSwiatek is not just winning, but winning easily, already amassing 16 sets taken by a 6-0 score in 2022 — and it's only early June.\n\nThe only Polish player to win a Grand Slam singles trophy, Swiatek does it with a mix of a topspin-laden heavy forehand — just like someone she admires greatly, 13-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal, who will face Casper Ruud in the men's final Sunday — and an all-court game, filled with variety and an appreciation of setting up moves ahead of time during a point. Much like a chess player, which she is.\n\nSwiatek's got other attributes, too, such as strong footwork that allows her to play defense when required.\n\nAlso key to Swiatek's presence, and swiftly burgeoning aura, is her calmness on court. She has traveled on tour with a sports psychologist, who was in Swiatek's guest box on Saturday, and works on various elements of her professional and personal lives.\n\nThat includes an emphasis on maintaining focus and setting priorities, such as the determination that she is still too new at this whole business of attempting to win Grand Slam titles that she decided it was best not to attend the Champions League soccer final in Paris last weekend, something Nadal did do.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "publish_date": "2022/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/french-open-live-updates-swiatek-paolini-final-latest-score-result/FgL3CqETT6N9/", "title": "How Iga Swiatek beat Jasmine Paolini to win fourth French Open ..."}, {"url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/live/french-open-2024-coco-gauff-iga-swiatek-square-off-semifinal-roland-garros-000035830.html", "title": "Iga Swiatek tops Coco Gauff in French Open semifinal, will play for ..."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/08/iga-swiatek-french-open/", "title": "Iga Swiatek wins French Open for third consecutive year - The ...", "text": "correction A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to the trophy given to the French Open women's singles champion as the Coupe des Mousquetaires. The trophy's name is the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen. The article has been corrected. There were moments in mid-April when Iga Swiatek would look at the calendar on her phone and wonder how she was going to make it to June. The life of an elite tennis player is a life lived on the road, and though Swiatek had done it many times before, her clay-court schedule was daunting. Playing back-to-back-to-back tournaments in Germany, Spain and Italy leading into the French Open is difficult for anyone. For the No. 1 player in the world, competing with what she often calls a target on her back, the pressure felt immense.\n\n“I was like, ‘Oh, my God,’ ” Swiatek said. “… It looks crazy. How am I going to survive that?”\n\nAt the end, there was only joy.\n\nOn Saturday at Roland Garros in Paris, Swiatek steamrolled Italy’s Jasmine Paolini, 6-2, 6-1, to win her third straight French Open title and her fourth in five years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 23-year-old from Poland fell to her knees in the red clay and pumped her fists several times before jumping around the court, her usual steely gaze giving way to an uncontained smile. She couldn’t stop yelling and was unwilling, it seemed, to stop running. She ran straight into the stands to celebrate with her family and coaches. She held an open palm up to a camera at one point, signaling five — as in five Grand Slam titles, including her triumph at the 2022 U.S. Open.\n\n“I love this place, honestly,” Swiatek said later. “I wait every year to come here.”\n\nShe didn’t have to wait long to hold the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen aloft Saturday. It took her 1 hour 8 minutes to complete the match that made her just the third woman in the Open era, which began in 1968, to capture three straight French Open titles, joining Monica Seles (1990-92) and Justine Henin (2005-07), and one of four women who have won more than three trophies at Roland Garros.\n\nThe others on that list? Chris Evert, a seven-time champion; Steffi Graf, a six-time champion; and Henin, a fellow four-time champion. To add to the occasion Saturday, Evert and two-time French Open winner Martina Navratilova were on hand for the trophy ceremony, Evert in a gleaming red suit.\n\nAs it was for those greats at their peak, Swiatek’s dominance on clay is unmatched in her era.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is an argument to be made that Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz, should he win the men’s title Sunday, will have claim to the title as Rafael Nadal’s successor at Roland Garros the year Nadal lost in the first round as his decorated career trickles to an end.\n\nThe reality is Nadal’s successor as ruler of red clay is already here. Swiatek sliced through the schedule that seemed so imposing back in April, picking up trophies in Madrid and Rome last month ahead of her victory at Roland Garros. She is the first woman to win all three events since Serena Williams in 2013.\n\nHer career record on clay stands at 85-10, her record at the French Open 35-2. That includes a winning streak of 21 matches in Paris.\n\n“These numbers are not, let’s say, normal,” Paolini said after the match. “[They] are something unbelievable.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwiatek’s path to the final had exactly one bump, a three-set match in the second round in which she fended off match points against Naomi Osaka. Otherwise, she glided to the final, dropping just 17 games in five other matches, including matches against fellow Grand Slam champions Marketa Vondrousova and Coco Gauff.\n\n“This tournament has been pretty surreal with its beginning and with second round, and then I was able to get my game better and better every match,” Swiatek said. “I’m really proud of myself because the expectations obviously have been pretty high from the outside — pressure as well. I’m happy that I just went for it, and I was ready to deal with all of this.”\n\nPaolini, a fresh surprise of a finalist, faced the unfortunate fate of meeting Swiatek at her full power.\n\nBorn and raised in Italy, Paolini, who is also of Polish and Ghanaian descent through her mother, is just 5-foot-4, inches shorter than most of her elite tennis playing peers, a quality she says limits her serve. And she entered 2024 with just one title and a 78-87 career record.\n\nHer career trajectory ticked up in January just as she turned 28. Her fourth-round run at the Australian Open was the first time she had made it past the second round at any of the four Grand Slams, and she picked up a title in Dubai in February. Entering Saturday she was 22-10 in 2024.\n\nThe difference, for the woman who said she “never dreamed so big” to consider winning a Grand Slam title, was confidence. In Paris on Sunday, she will play for the women’s doubles title alongside countrywoman and 2012 French Open singles finalist Sara Errani against Gauff and Katerina Siniakova.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Match by match, I felt more convinced that I can play at the higher level, you know. But it was a process. It’s not like I switch something. It was a process,” Paolini said earlier in the week.\n\nSaturday’s final set up a stylistic clash: Swiatek’s merciless efficiency and sly power against Paolini’s creativity and defense.\n\nPaolini didn’t have much of a chance to do anything but sprint from corner to corner chasing Swiatek’s shots. With her unrivaled anticipation and footwork, the Polish champion steadily dictated the match after a shaky opening three games, during which Paolini broke to take a 2-1 lead after 13 minutes.\n\nBut breaking Swiatek’s serve is one thing. Sustaining that level of play is another.\n\n“I never played a player that has this intensity before in my life,” Paolini said. “So was my first time facing a player that, yeah, is taking time as much as she does but also hitting winners. … I think I played, like, four games at that intensity. Then was tough. But I was trying to, you know, trying to hit as hard as I could the ball because if I just trying to put the ball into the court, [she hit] a winner. So you have to push, push, push every ball. Because if not, you have no chances to play the points.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwiatek righted herself in the first set and broke Paolini at love to even things at 2, finishing the game with a return winner and reeling off 10 games in a row.\n\nPaolini, who will make her top-10 debut Monday, called the French Open “the best days of my life” during the trophy ceremony despite the loss.", "authors": ["Ava Wallace"], "publish_date": "2024/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/37821150/iga-swiatek-karolina-muchova-win-french-open", "title": "Iga Swiatek vs. Karolina Muchova - Who will win the French Open ..."}, {"url": "https://www.rolandgarros.com/en-us/article/rg2024-day-14-as-it-happens---saturday-june-8", "title": "Day 14 as it happened - Saturday June 8 - Roland-Garros - The ..."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/40295117/swiatek-paolini-women-french-open-final", "title": "Swiatek vs. Paolini: Who will win the women's French Open final ..."}, {"url": "https://ausopen.com/articles/news/swiatek-v-osaka-battle-four-time-grand-slam-champions", "title": "Swiatek v Osaka: Battle of four-time Grand Slam champions | AO"}, {"url": "https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4035542/champions-corner-the-swiatek-mantra-serve-win-trophy-repeat", "title": "Champions Corner: The Swiatek mantra -- serve, win, trophy, repeat"}]}

Sign up\n\nIntroduced in 1980, the first iteration of the Right to Buy scheme was one of the flagship policies of Margaret Thatcher’s government. It allowed council house tenants to buy the homes they lived in and forced local authorities to sell their properties on request at a discount.\n\nUnder the policy as it stands today, council tenants can get up to 70% off the market price, depending on how long they have lived there – but the scheme is much more restrictive when it comes to housing associations.\n\nRight to Buy has proved to be a controversial policy in the intervening years, leading some to wonder if it should be revived.\n\n1. Pro: more on the housing ladder\n\nBetween 1980 and 2021, 1.8 million households in England purchased a home from their local authority using the Right to Buy scheme. The Telegraph said it “achieved its goal of getting more people on the housing ladder in its former years” but its “popularity has waned since”.\n\nThe BBC estimated that 2.4 million people rent from housing associations, so would now be eligible for the scheme. It added that Johnson will also “suggest allowing housing benefit to count towards a mortgage”.\n\nHowever, some experts have warned that it ignores the needs of private tenants.\n\n2. Con: fewer affordable homes\n\nHousing experts have warned the policy could significantly reduce the number of affordable homes available to renters amid a cost-of-living crisis, and have instead called for an increase in house building.\n\nPolly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, told The Guardian: “There could not be a worse time to sell off what remains of our last truly affordable social homes.” She added that “more people are on the brink of homelessness than homeownership”.\n\nOther experts have warned that the Thatcherite policy “left a trail of destruction in its wake” after the government failed to ensure houses that were being sold to tenants were replaced, leaving little housing stock left for those who relied on social housing, said The Telegraph. Since the launch of Right to Buy, “just 358,350 new local authority properties were built – a replacement rate of less than 20%”. The government is expected to mitigate this when it launches the scheme.\n\n3. Pro: historically popular policy\n\nFor Thatcher, the policy was a “resounding success”, transforming her political fortunes and becoming one of the most popular policies of the era, according to the Daily Mail. It said that in the first year alone, the government received up to 1,000 applications to buy each day. In the first two years of the scheme, more than 107,000 properties were sold to council tenants.\n\nMichael Heseltine, who as environment secretary was in charge of turning the policy into law, said at the time that “no single piece of legislation has enabled the transfer of so much capital wealth from the state to the people”.\n\nEven now, the idea of home ownership is a popular one, with 62% of Britons without property saying they would like to own their own home in the future, according to a YouGov poll last year.\n\nWhen Labour came to power in 1997, it reduced the discount available to tenants in local authorities, which put severe pressure on their housing stock, including almost the whole of London. But, as the Daily Mail noted: “Tony Blair’s government never actually attempted to abolish Right to Buy – perhaps wary of the huge backlash that could result.”\n\n4. Con: lack of good rental stock\n\nCritics have said that many of the “decent” housing association properties have already been sold off, leaving current housing association tenants with few tempting options if they were seeking to buy, said The Guardian.\n\nToby Lloyd, a housing consultant and former special adviser, told The Telegraph that the new policy could also prove “extraordinarily expensive” for the government.\n\n“The Conservative party has been promising to extend Right to Buy to housing associations for years, but the reason it has not been successful is because it is much harder,” he said.\n\n“The whole point of housing associations is they are independent charities and not part of the state, and so the Government cannot just help itself to their assets. It will be extraordinarily expensive to persuade them to sell houses off.”\n\n5. Pro: prevents social exclusion\n\nOne argument for proponents of Right to Buy is that it helps create communities of different social classes, and in neighbourhoods where Right to Buy has been taken up it is argued that “the presence of economically active households reduces the social exclusion of an area”.\n\nIt is also argued that people with a financial stake in their neighbourhood and property have “more incentive to look after it and the neighbourhood around it”, said The Guardian.\n\n6. Con: obstacles for tenants\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph, Neal Hudson, of BuiltPlace analysts, said that the demographic of social renters coupled with a huge rise in house prices means that a revival of Right to Buy would not be as successful as when it was introduced in the 1980s.\n\nThe paper said that “Hudson warned many tenants living in housing association properties were unlikely to be able to afford current house prices” even if they were given big discounts, as under the current Right to Buy scheme.\n\nHe added that property ownership was not always “suitable” for those using social rented housing, which he said was a “vital safety net for those on lower incomes and the vulnerable who can’t work”. He said that social housing tenants could fall into financial difficulty if they chose to buy their property, as “property ownership does come with additional, and sometimes unexpected, costs such as mortgage repayments and repairs”.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Staff", "Rebekah Evans", "Julia O'Driscoll", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/09/right-to-buy-homes-landlords-rentals-housing", "title": "Right to buy put homes in the hands of landlords. Rehashing it will ...", "text": "Among the slew of “red meat” policies that are now being put forward to shore up Boris Johnson’s position, there is one that ought to cause real concern for those want to see fair and balanced housing in this country. The government is proposing to resurrect right to buy for tenants in housing association properties, allowing tenants to potentially use their housing benefit in order to buy their social properties at discounts of up to 70% of market price.\n\nThis rehashing of one of Margaret Thatcher’s flagship policies originally formed part of the hugely contested and controversial Housing and Planning Act, introduced by the Conservatives in their 2015 general election manifesto. It was sidelined in 2016 by Theresa May and her chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, in favour of a more balanced approach that valued different types of housing: home ownership, private rental and “affordable” housing.\n\nThe paucity of detail in the current announcement suggests it is still at the drawing-board stage. It should stay there. There are a number of problems with the policy.\n\nMost obviously, these are not the government’s properties to sell. Housing associations are independent, mainly charitable organisations that were established with the main purpose of providing genuinely affordable homes for those on low incomes. Peabody, which I chair, was founded in 1862 by George Peabody, who sought to “ameliorate the conditions of the poor and needy” in London. It should not be for the government to oblige Peabody to sell its housing stock. And if it does, the cost of the substantial discounts must be fully reimbursed.\n\nIt is hard to think of a more inequitable and poor-value policy for a government committed to “levelling up”. Under the current right-to-buy scheme, which allows council-housed tenants to buy their homes from local authorities, the discounts are substantial. The tenant of a council-owned flat in London who has been renting from their local authority for three years could be eligible for a discount of up to £116,000. But the price of a typical flat in London can exceed £500,000. So even the current policy is available only to those with quite significant means.\n\nFully aware of the poor value of the scheme, the Treasury has been extremely reluctant to provide additional funds for it. The version of this policy pitched in the 2015 Conservative manifesto proposed to force local authorities to sell off their high value, typically larger and most-needed properties to pay for the discounts that housing associations would be required to offer tenants.\n\nAt the time it was first proposed, this policy was deeply divisive. It pitted councils against housing associations, and made little financial sense. It was quietly dropped. So where is the money going to come from this time? If the Treasury is not providing any new money to fund the discounts that housing associations will be obliged to offer new right-to-buy tenants, this funding will presumably come at the expense of other much-needed housing schemes.\n\nIn 2012 the coalition government introduced the one-for-one replacement policy. This was supposed to ensure that any council homes sold under right to buy were replaced, and was largely intended to assuage Liberal Democrats’ concerns that reinvigorating right to buy would lead to an irretrievable loss of social housing. In the lead-up to the 2015 general election, the Conservatives campaigned to extend right to buy to housing association tenants, with that same commitment to one-for-one replacement. But the policy has not worked. Despite government commitments, only a small proportion of the homes sold off under the existing right to buy scheme have been replaced.\n\nGiven the desperate need for more genuinely affordable rental housing, the government’s priority should be on reversing the long-term net loss of social housing, not adding to it. Housing associations, including Peabody, have already had to scale back their plans to build new homes as a result of rising construction costs. Instead of funding discounts for existing housing association tenants, the government should be putting money towards building new affordable homes available at genuinely affordable rents.\n\nThe clear evidence from the sale of council houses since Thatcher’s introduction of right to buy is that a high proportion of these properties do not stay owner occupied. Instead, many end up as buy-to-let investment vehicles whose absentee landlords charge rents that far outstrip those charged by local authorities. As a result, the amount of housing benefit paid to private landlords has soared over the last decade, and is now estimated to be more than £9bn. Analysis by Professor Alan Murie for the 2022 UK Housing Review produced by the Chartered Institute of Housing found that 40% of council-owned properties sold off under right to buy ended up as homes in the private rented sector.\n\nThe government is right to highlight the challenge posed by falling rates of home ownership. But there are far more effective ways to address this issue. We need to build more homes of all types and tenures. The planning proposals in the levelling up and regeneration bill published last month are a big improvement on what was in the government’s white paper from 2021, but there is a lot more that could be done to get Britain building. The government has dropped the target to build 300,000 new homes annually. Why not work collaboratively with the housing sector to see how we can make this a reality?\n\nWhen the 2015 policy was announced, the then mayor of London, one Boris Johnson, said that extending right to buy to housing associations would be the “height of insanity” if it did not lead to the creation of more affordable homes in the capital. We can say confidently that it won’t. Johnson was right the first time: the policy won’t work. It should be quietly dropped again.\n\nBob Kerslake is chair of the Peabody group board, former president of the Local Government Association, former head of the civil service and former permanent secretary at the Department for Communities and Local Government\n\n\n\n\n\n", "authors": ["Bob Kerslake"], "publish_date": "2022/06/09"}, {"url": "https://neweconomics.org/2022/05/the-damaging-legacy-of-right-to-buy", "title": "The damaging legacy of right to buy | New Economics Foundation"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/29/how-right-to-buy-ruined-british-housing", "title": "From Thatcher to Johnson: how right to buy has fuelled a 40-year ...", "text": "‘It feels like a way to change your fortunes – that’s the British dream,” says the writer and housing journalist Vicky Spratt on right to buy. When she began researching Tenants, her new book about Britain’s dysfunctional private housing market, she knew that Margaret Thatcher’s flagship policy, which has seen 2m homes bought by council tenants at massive discounts since 1980, was important.\n\nBy the time she finished it, Spratt realised it had “entered the public consciousness like no other policy, and in that respect it’s one of the most successful of all time”.\n\nThatcher would be disappointed, though. Forty-two years later, the “property-owning democracy” she craved is receding from view. When right to buy was launched as part of the Housing Act 1980, 55% of householders were homeowners. The figure peaked at 72% in the early 00s but currently stands at 65%. Meanwhile, council housing has decreased, too. In 1979, there were 6.5m council homes; now there are 2.2m, while 4.4m households rent privately, twice as many as 15 years ago.\n\nNevertheless, Boris Johnson recently announced that right to buy will be extended to tenants of housing associations – not-for-profit organisations that let homes to about 2.5 million people at rents of up to 80% of the market rate. Millions of right-to-buyers have “switched identities and psychology”, Johnson claimed, from state dependence to proud self-reliance, echoing Thatcher’s fixation on “the independence that comes with ownership”.\n\nPolly Neate, the chief executive of the housing charity Shelter, has said that extending the right to buy now, when the waiting list for social housing in England stands at 1.6m, is “baffling, unworkable and a dangerous gimmick”.\n\nThis is because although right to buy has succeeded spectacularly as a political slogan, its benefits have been starkly unequal. While an older generation of working- and lower-middle-class people gained their first big asset upon buying council homes in the 80s, millions of mostly younger people have now been forced into insecure, grotty, privately rented accommodation.\n\nView image in fullscreen An aerial view of Forest Gate in Newham, east London.

I only fully understood this when I spent several months last year making a BBC radio series, A Home of Our Own, about the ways in which people’s lives have been shaped, for better or worse, by their housing options.\n\nI spoke to Phil Salter, a 79-year-old retired carpenter in Cornwall, who bought his council house in Devon in the early 80s for £17,000. When it was valued at £80,000 in 1989, he sold up and used the equity to put towards a £135,000 fisherman’s cottage in St Mawes. Now it’s valued at £1.1m. “I was very grateful to Margaret Thatcher,” he said.\n\nBut back in south London, where Salter had spent his childhood in poor-quality private rented housing, I met Danielle Nicole, a 32-year-old who graduated 11 years ago, still living with her mum in the terrace house she bought in 1990 using proceeds from right to buy. Danielle, an NHS worker, could neither afford to buy – flats in the area cost upwards of £350,000 – nor rent privately, and with no dependants and a reasonable salary she would spend up to a decade on the waiting list for social housing.\n\nSalter and Nicole’s mother bought their homes at significant discounts – the original maximum discount was 50%, rising to 70% in 2012. The trouble was, their children had no chance of getting on the property ladder – at least, until they were able to inherit the home.\n\nA combination of low levels of housebuilding, “landbanking” by property developers and the equity pumped into the housing market by newly flush right-to-buy sellers carried on driving house prices upwards, while wages failed to keep up. As the first wave of right-to-buy beneficiaries sold up and moved on, ex-council homes started to enter the private rental market in ever greater numbers. Former right-to-buy properties now make up 40% of all available private rented housing across England, reaching a staggering 70.9% in Milton Keynes.\n\nLast year I met Dorine, a 30-year-old in Crawley, who lived with her husband, three small children and Dorine’s two teenage sisters in a poky, crumbling, two-bedroom ex-council flat that was now owned by a private landlord based in India. Universal credit paid most of their rent, but when their benefit was suddenly cut because Dorine’s husband did an hour’s overtime one week, they went into arrears on a flat covered in black mould that its owner had never even visited.\n\nSpratt heard a similar story, this time in Wythenshawe, a large garden city-style estate built on the edge of Manchester in the 1920s. She met Amy and Dan (not their real names), a young couple with children living in an ex-council house owned by a bullying local builder-cum-landlord who, they said, was “absolutely wadded” from letting local properties. “Dan’s own family had benefited from right to buy,” says Spratt. His mother had bought her council house, which she still lived in. “But he could see it was the reason there was no social housing and why they were stuck on the waiting list.”\n\nThis persistent theme, of housing security for older people resulting in stress and precarity for their children’s generation, is echoed by the ethnographer Joy White in her book Terraformed, an immersive study of race, class and the effects of gentrification in her native Forest Gate, east London. Forest Gate is in Newham, a densely populated borough with as much 1960s council (or ex-council) housing as there are Edwardian terraces. Newham is associated with the partial collapse of Ronan Point, a poorly constructed council tower block, in 1968 and, more recently, with its policy of trying to relieve pressure on its housing waiting list by moving local applicants to homes as far away as Stoke-on-Trent and Liverpool.\n\n“Some people did very well from right to buy. It’s important to say that for some people it worked, and it worked very well, individually,” says White. “But for society, the cost was high.”\n\nView image in fullscreen A row of terrace houses in Milton Keynes, where former right to buy properties make up almost 71% of rented properties. Photograph: Chunyip Wong/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nIn Terraformed, White writes about how she was able to move out of her family home and live independently at the age of 20, buying her own flat in Forest Gate on her sole earnings as a civil service clerk. Watching her now grownup daughter and her friends come of age in a time where there are no such options was one motivation for writing her book, which addresses the despair and fury of young working-class adults whose “options and choices are very, very limited. I don’t think people realise just how cut off and shut down those opportunities are. Most of the properties that were bought under right to buy came back on the market as private rented, and now we’re seeing the fallout.”\n\nThe history of right to buy is longer than most of us realise – Thatcher was merely the ideal salesperson for it. She capitalised on the decent incomes and thwarted consumer aspirations of many working-class people at the turn of the 70s and 80s. In fact, the earliest legislation on council housing, from the late 19th century, required local authorities to sell the housing they built within 10 years.\n\nFrom 1936, the minister of health could authorise councils to sell houses to individual tenants, a practice that stopped abruptly – though temporarily – when Labour was elected immediately after the war, putting Aneurin Bevan in charge of health and housing. Bevan imagined the building of excellent-quality council housing not only as essential to narrowing inequalities in public health, but as a way of forging a society where class mattered less. He pushed forward a programme of building large, several-bedroomed council houses with gardens to be rented by middle-class as well as working-class people, and not to “be sold to others merely because they have the money to buy them”.\n\nConservative MPs didn’t like this one bit. The Oxford historian Aled Davies has documented how in 1947, David Gammans, the MP for Hornsey, north London, pressurised Bevan to allow the local council to sell its houses to sitting tenants. When Bevan refused, Gammans accused him of “turning the British people into a race of propertyless proletarians”, declaring that every citizen ought to have “the unchallengeable right to buy his own house”.\n\nGammans was in luck. Labour lost the 1951 election, partly because Bevan was perceived to have been too slow to address the massive need for new housing after the war. (For his part, Bevan believed: “While we shall be judged for a year or two by the number of houses we build … we shall be judged in 10 years’ time by the type of houses we build.”) Throughout the 1950s, the Tories built plenty of council housing, but much of it in the form of flats and smaller houses, while the sale of more desirable council homes, usually inhabited by better-off tenants, recommenced on the quiet and grew in pace.\n\nBevan conceived of, and defended, council housing as a source of collective pride and a world-class public resource, just like his most celebrated creation, the NHS. Harold Macmillan, his successor as minister for housing, and later the Tory prime minister, was happy to build council housing as long as the goal of “a property-owning democracy” was maintained. Renting from the council wasn’t a lifelong state, merely a stepping stone to owner-occupation – and, ultimately, that’s the way it has stayed.\n\n“A lot of Labour advisers (in the 1970s) were very, very frustrated because they knew if they didn’t do it, the Tory party would walk in and do it,” the author Andy Beckett told me in 2017 on Streets Apart, a BBC radio series tracing the history of social housing. Covertly, said Beckett, “it appealed to [Thatcher’s] idea of the respectable working class”.\n\nThe right to buy didn’t benefit all council tenants. “It was particularly attuned to the needs of wealthier, often skilled, working-class, older voters and those were the kinds of people Thatcher wanted to secure as Conservative voters. It wasn’t really a policy for single mothers or the poor because they couldn’t afford to buy and Thatcher was keen to peel off the skilled working class from the Labour party.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Margaret Thatcher, as leader of the opposition in 1978, handing the deeds of a council house over to its new owners in Balham, south London. Photograph: David Ashdown/Getty Images\n\nIn August 1980, Thatcher visited Margaret and James Patterson, the 12,000th tenants to buy their council home under the new legislation, at their house in Harold Hill, east London. In the photos, the PM looks as pleased as they do – suspecting, perhaps, that she was on to a winner. The Pattersons weren’t so lucky. The couple couldn’t afford to keep up the mortgage payments at a time of double-figure interest rates, leading to their divorce – and forcing Margaret to live in a caravan when she had to sell the house.\n\nLabour formally abandoned its opposition to the policy in the mid-1980s, when council-house sales ran at more than 150,000 a year.\n\nProf Becky Tunstall, a fellow at York University’s Centre for Housing Policy, has spent decades researching the fortunes of 20 council estates in different parts of England – some peripheral, some inner-city.\n\nIn 1980, all 20 estates were classed as “hard to let” – that is, people offered homes on them tended to turn them down, whether because of reputation, location, size or a combination of all three. Right to buy had little effect on these estates for decades, says Tunstall. “It wasn’t really until the late 90s that residents in those estates began to take it up.”\n\nThat wasn’t so much because the properties had improved, she says, but because the shockingly high unemployment rates on many estates in the 80s had begun to fall, and many, though not all, tenants had money for the first time. And crucially, “the total stock was shrinking. Over the 90s and 00s, [social housing] became more of a precious commodity.” Estates became easier to let because would-be tenants had fewer housing options to choose from.\n\nThe economic geographer Brett Christophers, author of The New Enclosure and of Rentier Capitalism, has argued that right to buy is one of the biggest acts of privatisation ever undertaken, transferring £40bn in the last 42 years directly to the Treasury. This money was effectively never seen again, lost in a soup of national debt repayments and tax cuts. It has served as a way of funnelling money and power away from the local authorities which once built and maintained millions of homes.\n\nView image in fullscreen Boris Johnson with Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Michael Gove and Nadine Dorries in Blackpool, where the prime minister delivered his speech on housing. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Right to buy was very much part and parcel of the defanging of power at the local political level in the UK,” he says. “That’s been a much wider process, the centralisation of power, both temporally and geographically, but it was a very important part of that process, partly because it was implemented in such a way that the housing couldn’t and wouldn’t be replaced. Councils were basically denied the ability to stop it happening.”\n\nThe net result is not only that local authorities can do relatively little about their local housing problems without deferring to central government, but that right to buy devalues renting as opposed to owning. “The more that rental housing comes to be seen as something that is not desirable, not worthy, and not part of the ‘normal’ aspirational life,” says Christophers, “the more you pump up the bubble around home ownership. Right to buy is not just a problem of, and in, the rental sector, it’s a problem for housing as a whole.”\n\nTunstall adds that what’s needed is more good housing with security of tenure, regardless of whether it’s owned or rented. “Now is the time to argue for more housebuilding, as everyone knows the cost of living crisis is not just about pasta. Housing takes a huge chunk out of people’s budgets. Really, housing costs are the cost of living crisis. Now, more than ever, we need to think about housing for everybody.”", "authors": ["Lynsey Hanley"], "publish_date": "2022/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckkg2l1rpr4o", "title": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves to bring back housebuilding targets"}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/12bvjle/theres_just_something_off_about_nascar_as_of_late/", "title": "There's just something “off,” about NASCAR as of late, and I just can ..."}, {"url": "https://hls.harvard.edu/today/what-critics-get-wrong-and-right-about-the-supreme-courts-new-major-questions-doctrine/", "title": "What critics get wrong — and right — about the Supreme Court's ..."}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1028vbl/is_the_uk_really_that_bad_right_now/", "title": "Is the UK really that bad right now? : r/expats"}, {"url": "https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/right-to-buy-past-present-and-future/", "title": "Right to buy: Past, present and future - House of Lords Library"}, {"url": "https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2022/12/29/brexit-draft-deal-first-of-many-hurdles-to-a-smooth-exit", "title": "Post-Brexit Guide: What's been the impact — and how did it happen ...", "text": "Euronews' updated explainer examines the far-reaching effects of the UK's departure from the EU and the events that led to Brexit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis updated article was previously titled \"Post-Brexit Guide: Where are we now — and how did we get here?\".\n\nThe effects of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union have been far-reaching, impacting business and the economy, as well as people on both sides of the English Channel and many aspects of their lives.\n\nThis guide examines the impact of Brexit so far, nearly three years after the UK left the EU and two years since the new relationship took effect. It looks back at the drawn-out negotiation process, Britain's difficult historical relationship with Europe, and there's also a postscript on how the EU works.\n\nPART ONE: BREXIT'S IMPACT\n\nThe United Kingdom's departure from the European Union — now a 27-nation economic and political partnership — brought to an end nearly half a century of British membership of the EU and the institutions that preceded it.\n\n\"Brexit\" — an abbreviation of \"Britain\" and \"exit\" — represents the most important constitutional shake-up the UK has known since it joined the then six-nation European Economic Community in 1973. It is also the first time the European bloc has lost a member.\n\nThe UK and Brexit: Unfinished business\n\nBoris Johnson, Britain's last-but-one prime minister, campaigned successfully on the promise to \"get Brexit done\". But although the UK duly left the EU on mutually-agreed terms, and a subsequent deal was struck on trade and future ties, the country is still wrestling with itself and Brussels over the post-Brexit relationship.\n\nA breakthrough in the longstanding dispute over trading arrangements for Northern Ireland — which also plagued the tortuous divorce process — brought hopes of warmer UK-EU relations after two years of post-Brexit tensions, as well as an end to the political paralysis in the UK territory. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government succeeded in striking a new deal with the EU in February 2023. Unionists bitterly opposed to the original treaty agreed to study the terms.\n\nIncreasing evidence of Brexit's negative impact on Britain's economy put its new trading terms with the continent under scrutiny. New border controls and immigration restrictions, the result of the UK's choices, have disrupted commerce and the supply of labour. Business in particular has challenged the UK government's aim to exploit its new-found autonomy by pursuing a divergent path from EU norms.\n\nThere is evidence of some \"Brexit remorse\" among the British public, with some opinion polls suggesting a growing majority of voters now regretted the UK's departure from the EU. But there is little appetite for reviewing the UK's formal relationship with the EU, not least among the major political parties.\n\nRishi Sunak's arrival in Downing Street stemmed the resurgence of political turmoil that brought down his predecessors Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. But the fallout from Brexit has continued to shake the ruling Conservative Party, where the influence of hard-line, anti-EU factions who may resist compromise with the EU remains strong.\n\nThe mood between London and Brussels became warmer in the latter half of 2022, although core issues remain unresolved. Brussels will have noted the Tories' consistently poor poll ratings and the distinct possibility that the next UK election, due by January 2025, may bring a change of government.\n\nFriction between the UK and the EU has been tempered to some extent by a recognition of the need for European unity with Ukraine. But for many in Europe, the divorce has weakened the continent as it tries to face up to global challenges including Russia's war, the post-pandemic economic downturn, the climate emergency, and threats posed by China and Iran.\n\nMeanwhile, post-Brexit tensions have continued in Scotland where a majority voted to remain in the EU, and the devolved government has been barred by the UK Supreme Court from holding a new referendum on independence without approval from London.\n\nBrexit in dates\n\n23 June, 2016: The UK votes to leave the EU by 52% to 48% in a referendum.\n\nThe UK votes to leave the EU by 52% to 48% in a referendum. 31 January, 2020: The UK leaves the EU under the terms of a negotiated divorce deal, but most arrangements remain the same under an 11-month \"transition period\".\n\nThe UK leaves the EU under the terms of a negotiated divorce deal, but most arrangements remain the same under an 11-month \"transition period\". 24 December, 2020: The UK and the EU strike a last-minute agreement on post-Brexit trade and future relations, after months of deadlocked negotiations, heading off a damaging \"no-deal\" scenario.\n\nThe UK and the EU strike a last-minute agreement on post-Brexit trade and future relations, after months of deadlocked negotiations, heading off a damaging \"no-deal\" scenario. 31 December, 2020: The transition period expires, and the terms of the UK's new life outside the EU come into force on 1 January, 2021.\n\nThe economy and trade\n\nAs in other countries, there are numerous factors behind the UK's economic woes — not least the fallout from COVID-19, Russia's war on Ukraine and the consequent energy crisis — but there is a near consensus among economists that Brexit has made them worse.\n\nAn official forecast by the government's own independent analysts estimates that the new UK-EU trading relationship will \"reduce long-run productivity by 4% relative to remaining in the EU\".\n\n2022 has brought a slew of reports indicating that the UK has underperformed since the onset of the pandemic, compared to its peers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOfficial figures have shown that its economy was alone among G7 countries in having shrunk. A report by the Centre for European Reform in December 2022 is the latest to illustrate how Brexit has hit the UK's GDP, investment and trade. Opinions vary over the impact of Brexit on the UK's high inflation rate, but it has been linked to rising food prices.\n\nBoris Johnson, who as prime minister struck the post-Brexit EU-UK trade deal in late 2020, made several erroneous claims about it, saying that there would be \"no non-tariff barriers to trade\", and that it would allow UK firms \"to do even more business with our European friends\".\n\nIn fact, several reports have detailed a steep fall in UK-EU imports and exports, with many particularly smaller companies stopping cross-Channel trade altogether. A British Chamber of Commerce report in December 2022 finds the trade deal is still \"not delivering\" for more than three-quarters of firms.\n\nThe EU-UK trade agreement which came into force in 2021 allows for tariff-free, quota-free access to each other's markets for goods — but not services — and also covers future competition, fishing rights, and cooperation on matters such as security.\n\nwhich came into force in 2021 allows for tariff-free, quota-free access to each other's markets for goods — but not services — and also covers future competition, fishing rights, and cooperation on matters such as security. The UK's departure from the EU's Single Market and Customs Union brought significant new border formalities and regulatory controls. The EU had previously stressed that these would bring more red tape and \"longer delivery times\", a warning that appears to have been borne out.\n\nSome reports said the damage began even before the UK actually left the EU, a fall in the pound in the wake of the Brexit referendum causing import prices to rise in particular.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe UK's departure from the EU has hit the continent too, although Britain has yet to impose full regulatory constraints on EU imports. An EU report in February 2022 described an uneven impact across Europe, with northern and western regions more exposed overall.\n\nCitizens' rights: residency and travel\n\nBrexit brought to an end the right to \"free movement\" (a conditional not absolute right of EU citizens to move to other EU countries) between the UK and the EU. However, the divorce deal protects the existing rights of Europeans living in the UK, and Britons on the continent, who were already resident when Brexit took effect.\n\nThose resident in their particular country by the end of the transition period continue to have the same rights to live, work, study, and access benefits and services there.\n\nThe UK has granted \"settled status\" to more than six million people under its EU Settlement Scheme for EU, EEA (European Economic Area) and Swiss nationals, along with their family members living in the country.\n\nHowever, a significant minority of people have experienced serious problems. Hundreds of thousands of applicants have been caught in a backlog, and there have been issues in securing rights for family members. Meanwhile, many have complained of difficulties proving their status as the digital-only scheme issues no physical documents.\n\nIn a December 2022 report, researchers from Kings College London highlighted injustices due to a series of bureaucratic contradictions linked to the application process.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBritons living in the EU by the end of 2020 also have the right to stay but need to have the right paperwork. This varies across EU countries, with some adopting a stricter approach than others. There have been complaints of access to basic rights being denied because of a lack of proper documentation.\n\nSecondly, although the Brexit deal guarantees British residents' rights in their individual host country, it grants no automatic rights to move to other EU countries to live and work. This too has caused problems for some travelling between different EU countries.\n\nResearch has identified particular problems for \"mixed status\" families — mostly where one partner is British, the other European.\n\nBritons without residency rights in the EU are now affected by rules whereby non-EU visitors are only allowed to visit Schengen area countries for 90 days in every 180 day period.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFrom May 2023, UK visitors to the EU will be subject to a new automated Entry Exit System (EES) for third-country nationals entering the bloc.\n\nImmigration and labour shortages\n\nSeveral sectors of the UK economy have suffered severe labour shortages due to a number of factors, including Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic. Other countries too have experienced problems, but they have been particularly acute in Britain.\n\nMany European workers have returned to their home countries from the UK, and the stricter entry conditions have not facilitated their return. Euronews has chronicled the impact across a range of sectors, from farming to hospitality.\n\nUnder the UK's new immigration rules EU nationals no longer have preferential treatment, and many low-skilled jobs are now off-limits for them. Instead, a new points-based system is designed to attract skilled workers. Although net migration to the UK has risen sharply, among EU nationals it is estimated to have fallen.\n\nA study by Oxford University's Migration Observatory in August 2022 said evidence suggested that UK immigration policy was one of multiple factors contributing to shortfalls in the workforce.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe government's migration advisers also cite Brexit — along with rising economic activity, high job vacancy rates, soaring inflation and Russia's war against Ukraine — for contributing to an unstable labour market.\n\nThe Migration Advisory Committee's annual report in December 2022 said the end of EU free movement had caused \"a labour supply shock to the UK economy\", especially in sectors most reliant on EU-born workers\" such as hospitality, logistics, administration, manufacturing, and agriculture.\n\nThe MAC highlights multiple efforts by employers to seek British workers, raise pay and improve other measures to retain staff, and maximise use of recruitment schemes — often in vain.\n\nBusiness leaders have called on the government to relax immigration rules, but the migration committee says it \"should resist calls to open new visa routes without a strong economic rationale\", due to the risk of migration workers being exploited.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut it accuses the government of \"a lack of joined-up thinking\", with \"no coherent, overarching strategy for skills and employment\", and appeals for a \"sustainable long-term policy to address shortages\" by tackling the \"root causes\".\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nIn late February 2023 the UK and the EU reached a breakthrough deal in the dispute over trading arrangements set out in the Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the legally binding Brexit divorce deal.\n\nAlthough part of the UK, Northern Ireland continues to follow some EU rules to keep an open land border with the Irish Republic, an EU member. It remains in the EU's single market for goods, benefitting Northern Ireland's manufacturers who have access to both EU and UK markets.\n\nNorthern Ireland unionists have vehemently opposed the original protocol because of the internal UK \"Irish Sea border\" it created, putting restrictions on trade from Great Britain.\n\nStudies have suggested variously that Northern Ireland's growth has outperformed the rest of the UK — but also that new trade frictions with Britain have a significantly negative impact.\n\nThe \"Windsor Framework\" announced by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen followed a thaw in relations since the fractious stand-off during the premierships of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.\n\nA subsequent agreement on data sharing helped. So did a commitment by the British government to drop the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill — a controversial measure introduced by the Johnson government seeking to override the original treaty if necessary, and which prompted retaliatory legal action by the EU.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe new accord introduces a \"green lane\" for goods sent from Britain to Northern Ireland only, and eased checks on goods heading south to the Republic. British medicines should be allowed to circulate freely in the territory. Restrictions should be removed on parcels, sausages, seed potatoes and plants sent from Britain.\n\nA \"Stormont Brake\", named after the devolved Northern Ireland assembly, is designed to address the \"democratic deficit\" by giving Northern Ireland a greater say over new EU rules. The UK government has hailed the measure as granting a potential veto, but the conditions for its use are strict.\n\nDespite the new accord, political obstacles remained high. In particular it was unclear whether Conservative Brexiteers and the main unionist party, the DUP (Democratic Unionist Party) — vehemently opposed to the original protocol because of the internal UK \"Irish Sea border\" it created — would accept it, and end its boycott of Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive, a requirement of the 1998 peace accord that ended decades of sectarian trouble.\n\nThe stakes are high. A solution to the Northern Ireland impasse could also unlock other areas of friction between London and Brussels, such as a return for UK science to the EU Horizon research scheme, held up by the row over the protocol. It could also bring improved cooperation in areas such as migration, energy, defence and cyber security.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe 25th anniversary of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement in April 2023 concentrated minds. New elections for the Belfast Assembly have been postponed, but cannot be put off indefinitely. All sides will need to consider the costs of failing to compromise.\n\nTrade deals with non-EU countries\n\nSince 2021 the UK has been free to pursue an independent trade policy under Brexit, and its supporters have often championed the ability to strike trade deals with other countries.\n\nBut to date there has been no trade deal with the United States, a big prize promised by some, while a target for striking a free trade agreement with India was also missed.\n\nDeals have been signed with dozens of other non-EU countries — but most have been \"roll over\" EU agreements with those nations which the UK benefitted from as a former EU member, but which no longer applied once it left the bloc.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe UK government hailed an early agreement struck with Japan as \"historic\", but it differed little from the EU deal the UK lost access to, and official figures show British exports to the country actually fell in 2022.\n\nA trade deal agreed with Australia has been criticised by the British farming industry and even a former Conservative agriculture minister for making too many concessions with little in return. The government's own assessment estimates that it will boost long-term GDP by just 0.08% by 2035.\n\nDismantling EU laws and regulations\n\nThe UK government is keen to highlight the \"Brexit opportunities\" that freedom from EU rules offers. However, the evidence so far that the benefits outweigh the costs is thin on the ground.\n\nA Retained EU Law bill put before parliament is designed to deliver a promise to \"review or revoke\" all EU law still applicable in the UK by the end of 2023. The so-called \"Brexit Freedoms\" bill has been criticised for being driven by ideology and described by an independent watchdog as \"not fit for purpose\". There are fears that the sheer volume of law set to be wiped off the statute book risks creating many a legal vacuum and threatens established rights such as worker protections.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA reform package has been put forward for financial services, seen as an attempt to boost the City of London which has lost ground to European centres since Brexit. Some measures have been welcomed, but critics condemn the reforms as risky and say they will do little to offset the damage cause by new barriers with the EU.\n\nUK government plans to set up new post-Brexit regulatory regimes, to replace so-called \"EU red tape\", have sparked alarm in sectors from food to chemicals, which fear crippling new costs.\n\nA UK replacement scheme for EU farming subsidies has been delayed, although a new regime to control state subsidies and replace the EU version is set to come into force in early January 2023.\n\nServices, science and education\n\nUK service providers can no longer operate across national borders in the EU as they did before, something which has caused particular concern in the music industry. There is no automatic mutual recognition of professional qualifications.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBrexit has also meant some mobile operators reintroducing data roaming charges for UK travellers in the EU, and vice versa.\n\nAn EU decision recognising compliance of the UK's data protection regime with EU law means personal data can continue to flow between the UK and the EU in the post-Brexit era. This can be reviewed after four years.\n\nThe UK has begun legal action against the EU claiming it has been unfairly excluded from the bloc's science programmes such as Horizon Europe, amid the row over Northern Ireland. The February 2023 deal on Northern Ireland trading arrangements brought hopes that the UK could return to the fold.\n\nBrexit has also impacted the world of education. No longer part of the EU's Erasmus+ student exchange programme, the UK has set up its own replacement scheme. There has been a drop in the number of EU student applications to UK universities, and a reported decline in the number of school trips between the UK and the EU.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPART TWO: The REFERENDUM and the BREXIT DEALS\n\n'Taking back control': The background to Brexit\n\nThe UK voted to leave the EU by 52% to 48% in a referendum in June 2016. The campaign message that the country wanted to \"take back control\" of its borders, money and laws resonated with voters.\n\nThe vote followed decades of increasing hostility to the European project, which enforced the supremacy of EU law in certain areas and whose \"freedom of movement\" principle led to millions of EU citizens moving to the UK to work and settle.\n\nOther factors cited as having had an influence were a rise in nationalist sentiment, particularly in England, as well as austerity and frustration with traditional politics. The outcome has fed into a wider debate over the role of the nation-state and the rise of populism in an age of globalisation.\n\nThe vote revealed strains between the UK's individual countries: England (53%) and Wales (52.5%) voted to leave the EU, whereas Scotland and Northern Ireland voted by 62% and 56% respectively to remain. Other divisions have also been exposed: between metropolitan areas and small towns for example, and different age groups and social classes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe referendum's aftermath plunged the UK into its worst political and constitutional crisis since the Second World War. Brexit day was repeatedly delayed amid deadlock in the British parliament over the divorce terms negotiated with the European Union.\n\nPost-Brexit TRADE AND FUTURE COOPERATION AGREEMENT\n\nAfter the UK finally left the EU on 31 January, 2020, London and Brussels raced against time throughout the year to reach an agreement on the future EU-UK relationship, to take effect from January 2021. Failure would have seen the two sides revert to basic international trading rules, increasing costs and disruption, and leaving arrangements on other matters in limbo (see \"No Deal\" sections below).\n\nThe main obstacles to a deal were EU fishing rights in UK waters, safeguards to ensure fair competition, and a mechanism to enforce a deal.\n\nThis all came amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the greatest economic crisis in Europe since World War II.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe deal struck on Christmas Eve 2020 — the Trade and Future Cooperation Agreement (TCA) — came too late to allow a conventional ratification process to take place. It was approved by EU national leaders and the UK parliament, and came into force provisionally at New Year. Ratification by the European Parliament followed in late April 2021.\n\nThe post-Brexit EU-UK deal on trade and future relations preserves tariff-free, quota-free access to each other's markets for goods. It banished the threat of a catastrophic \"no-deal scenario\" that could have sent thousands of businesses to the wall.\n\nHowever, it came with many strings attached — and the UK's departure from the EU's Single Market and Customs Union brought extra bureaucracy and costs for importers and exporters on both sides of the English Channel.\n\nTrade and competition\n\nThe two sides can diverge on the likes of employment and environmental standards, but there are safeguards — a \"rebalancing mechanism\" governed by arbitration — to ensure fair competition.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe UK is beyond the remit of EU law or the European Court of Justice (ECJ). But challenges are possible in each other's courts, and punitive measures may be taken if subsidies distort trade.\n\nAnd for service industries — highly important to the UK — the deal heralded further uncertainty, as it contained only vague commitments. Financial services were not covered at all, to be dealt with by a separate process.\n\nFishing rights\n\nThe trade deal brought a five-and-a-half-year transition period on fisheries — one of the main stumbling blocks in the negotiations. During that time, EU access to UK waters will be cut by a quarter, and British quotas will be increased.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnnual negotiations will then take place, but the EU can take retaliatory action if access is further reduced. And the UK, which sells most of its fish into the EU, is likely to continue to need the European market.\n\nPost-Brexit fault lines came to the fore in the autumn of 2021 with a row between the UK and France, irate at dozens of its boats being denied access to waters off the coasts of England and the Channel island of Jersey.\n\nFuture cooperation\n\nThere will still be cross-border police investigations and law enforcement. The UK remains in some EU security exchange programmes, but is no longer part of the European Arrest Warrant or Europol.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe UK also stays in the European Convention on Human Rights. But several other key policy areas are excluded from the accord.\n\n\"Foreign policy, external security and defence cooperation is not covered by the Agreement as the UK did not want to negotiate this matter,\" the European Commission said in its statement.\n\nSupervision and dispute settlement\n\nA joint Partnership Council is set up under the deal to supervise its application. It has representatives from both sides, will meet at least once a year, and has the power to change parts of the deal if errors come to light.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA separate arbitration and dispute settlement mechanism is set up, which does not rely on EU law and includes no role for the European Court of Justice.\n\nEducation, energy, science\n\nScientific cooperation was due to continue with the UK remaining in the EU's Horizon Europe programme for seven years. It was also set to stay in the EU's Earth observation programme Copernicus and the nuclear energy organisation Euratom.\n\nHowever, access has been blocked amid the row over the Northern Ireland Protocol and in August 2022 the UK launched legal action against the EU.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe UK has left the EU's Erasmus+ student exchange programme, to set up a new UK international study and training programme, the Turing Scheme.\n\nBREXIT DIVORCE DEAL: The UK's exit terms\n\nThe UK's departure from the EU on January 31, 2020 took effect under the terms of the revised divorce agreement struck by London and Brussels in October 2019.\n\nAn ill-fated previous version negotiated under Theresa May's UK premiership met stiff opposition in the British parliament which repeatedly rejected it. The new accord was negotiated by her successor, Boris Johnson, whose subsequent election victory ensured its rapid ratification.\n\nThe deal consists of a Withdrawal Agreement on the terms of departure, accompanied by a Political Declaration on future ties.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe deal also established a transition period which came into effect upon the UK’s departure and ran until December 31, 2020. During this period many existing arrangements remained in place.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement: a binding treaty\n\nThe revised Withdrawal Agreement kept many of the provisions in the deal previously negotiated by Theresa May's government.\n\nThe divorce terms contained in it cover matters such as the UK's financial settlement, provisions for Northern Ireland, and citizens' rights: safeguards for the rights of EU nationals living in the UK, and Britons living on the continent.\n\nIt establishes a mechanism for calculating the amount of money the UK owes the EU to settle its obligations. No figure is mentioned but estimates have put it above €40 billion. It includes contributions to be paid during the transition period.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe agreement also protects residency and social security rights for EU nationals living in the UK and Britons in the EU, and maintains freedom of movement until the end of the transition period. People already resident will be allowed to stay afterwards and apply for permanent residence after five years.\n\nThe main change from the deal negotiated by Theresa May's government is that the controversial Irish \"backstop\" contained in the previous accord (see below) — to keep an open border on the island of Ireland — is scrapped in the revised agreement.\n\nThe divorce terms came into force when the UK left the EU at the end of January under the ratified deal, and have the force of an international treaty.\n\nArrangements for Northern Ireland agreed in 2019\n\nBrexit means that the border between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (part of the EU) — one of the most politically sensitive frontiers in the world — becomes the European Union's only land border with the United Kingdom. All sides agreed throughout the process that this must remain open, but the historically sensitive and complex issue bedevilled the divorce talks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe arrangements in the Northern Ireland Protocol in the divorce deal agreed between Boris Johnson and the EU, as in the previous version negotiated by his predecessor Theresa May's government, are designed to avoid a hard border — such as border posts — and protect the cross-frontier economy.\n\nAs of January 2021 and the end of the transition period, Northern Ireland left the EU's Customs Union with the rest of the UK, which wanted to pursue an independent trade policy. But in practice, it has still been subject to EU customs rules and EU oversight.\n\nThe North remained aligned with some aspects of the EU's Single Market — and applies EU law on VAT (Value Added Tax) rules.\n\nNorthern Ireland was guaranteed \"unfettered access\" to the UK's internal market. But the rules meant there was effectively a new regulatory divide in the Irish Sea, especially concerning goods sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCustoms and regulatory checks would not be carried out on the island of Ireland, but at ports. The UK government accepted that there would be some controls on goods, backtracking on Boris Johnson's previous insistence that there would be no checks.\n\nIn December 2020, the EU and the UK struck agreement on details for implementing the arrangements for Northern Ireland contained in the divorce deal. As part of the accord, the British government agreed to ditch a controversial plan to override parts of the original deal which would have breached international law.\n\nThe implementation of the protocol from January 2021 brought more conflict, as trade between Britain and Northern Ireland was disrupted. The Johnson government moved to disapply parts of the accord unilaterally, and later introduced more legislation paving the way for the treaty to be overriden.\n\nThe UK and the EU remained at loggerheads over the issue until the new agreement struck by British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in February 2023 (see above section).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGoodbye to the backstop\n\nJohnson's revised protocol on Northern Ireland replaced the plan in the previous, rejected withdrawal deal known as the backstop. In the absence of a trade deal or an alternative solution, Theresa May's idea was for the whole of the UK to remain in a customs union with the EU, while Northern Ireland would be aligned even more closely with EU rules. The backstop's removal means this arrangement will no longer happen.\n\nThe revised agreement had similarities with an original EU proposal for a Northern Ireland-only backstop — which was rejected by May's government — but was more complex, and had one key difference in that legally, Northern Ireland remained in the UK customs union.\n\nThe accord dealt with the issue of Northern Irish consent for these changes: Northern Ireland's assembly would be able to decide on whether to keep the new arrangements — but only four years after the transition period.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Political Declaration: Divorce deal pledges for the future\n\nAs part of the Brexit divorce deal, the EU and the UK also issued a Political Declaration on the shape of future EU-UK relations. The document provided a framework designed to form the basis for the future trade agreement.\n\nBoth sides signed up to various assurances on future trade competition and other matters. This included a commitment to a \"level playing field\" covering issues such as state aid, social and workers' rights, the environment and climate change.\n\nThe declaration related to a future EU-UK economic relationship where the UK opted for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). But in return for zero tariffs and quotas, the UK made \"robust commitments\" to ensure \"open and fair competition\".\n\nHowever, the document was legally non-binding — as opposed to the divorce deal's Withdrawal Agreement, on the terms of the UK's departure, which has the force of an international treaty. Critics were wary that the commitments might not be watertight — especially given the Johnson government's avowed intention to diverge from EU rules and forge an independent trading path.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome observers argued that negotiations over future ties risked being much more complicated and harder to resolve than the terms of the divorce deal. The stalemate resulting from the talks in 2020 appeared to bear this out — although in the end a deal on the future relationship was struck in the nick of time.\n\nHowever, its application in the years to come is bound to involve many more negotiations and, inevitably, disputes.\n\nPART THREE: HOW DID BREXIT HAPPEN?\n\nBrexit follows decades of UK soul-searching over Europe\n\nThe United Kingdom's place in Europe — and vice-versa — is an issue that arguably was never properly resolved after the Second World War, and came to a head with the Brexit referendum.\n\nMany in the UK, especially in England, have always been sceptical of the political pan-European project revered by many on the continent. The antagonism towards the EU that surfaced during Margaret Thatcher's premiership in the 1980s has been followed by decades of hostile media coverage, especially in British tabloids.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt the heart of the debate in the UK has been the balance to be struck between two objectives: a desire for independence, sovereignty and autonomy against the need to retain influence and access to European markets, which, the EU insists, means respecting its rules and committing to fairness in competition.\n\nThe turmoil in the British domestic political scene has cut across party lines. Internal party divisions have affected both the UK government and opposition. The ruling Conservative party in particular has long been riven between Eurosceptic and Europhile factions.\n\nA history of UK-EU tension\n\nCheck out our series on the history of the United Kingdom's complicated relations with the European Union:\n\nFROM BREXIT VOTE TO EU EXIT DOOR\n\nTheresa May's deal repeatedly rejected by UK parliament\n\nThe referendum result in June 2016 prompted the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron — who had led the campaign to keep the UK in the EU. He was replaced the following month by Theresa May, who in March 2017 triggered the EU's Article 50 — giving formal notification of the UK's intention to leave — two years later on March 29, 2019.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLondon and Brussels then negotiated a withdrawal deal over an 18-month period, which was finally agreed in November 2018 and approved by the 27 other EU governments.\n\nThe former prime minister insisted her negotiated withdrawal agreement was in the national interest and there was no viable alternative. She argued that it delivered on the referendum result: an end to free movement, an end to huge UK payments to the EU, and an exit from the unpopular EU structures on farming and fishing.\n\nHowever, May had been severely weakened at home by an ill-judged snap election in June 2017 which wiped out her majority in parliament. Her government struggled on thanks to a deal with Northern Irish unionists. But the EU agreement brought hostility from both opponents and supporters of Brexit, including many in the ruling Conservative Party.\n\nThanks to an alliance of forces, the EU divorce deal was rejected three times by the UK parliament between January and March 2019 — causing Brexit to be delayed and leading eventually to May's resignation and her replacement by Boris Johnson.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more:What was in Theresa May's Brexit deal and why was it so unpopular?\n\nDerailed by the backstop\n\nTo guarantee an open border, the backstop envisaged the UK remaining in a \"single customs territory\" with the EU, in the absence of a free trade deal or an alternative solution. It proved to be a major stumbling block in the negotiations.\n\nEurosceptic critics, including the Conservative anti-EU European Research Group (ERG), suspected it would have kept the UK strapped permanently to EU trade policy. EU sources pointed out that the UK-wide mechanism in the withdrawal agreement was included at the UK’s request, to avoid splitting off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNorthern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), on whose support the May government depended, has always vehemently opposed any move it believes might separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom. Under the backstop, as set out in May's deal, Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules.\n\nRevisions fail to stop defeats\n\nIn 2019, as the clock ticked down towards the original March 29 deadline, the UK and the EU said they had agreed a revised Brexit deal following weeks of deadlocked talks between London and Brussels.\n\nEU27 leaders had refused to alter the text of the withdrawal agreement. But Theresa May said she had secured legally-binding changes over the backstop’s application. The British parliament had voted to seek “alternative arrangements”.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe parliamentary deadlock prompted moves by MPs from different parties to wrest control of the Brexit process and allow a series of \"indicative votes\" to explore alternative solutions to the government's deal. But there was no majority for any particular solution, other than an opposition to no-deal.\n\nRead more:How Brexit defined then destroyed Theresa May's premiership\n\nTheresa May's Brexit battles\n\nTheresa May always struggled to keep the pro and anti-European wings of the Conservative Party on board with her Brexit plans.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHer doomed UK-EU divorce deal represented a compromise. But the blurring of several of her so-called \"red lines\" on the limits of EU power sparked fury within her divided Conservative Party. As negotiations with Brussels brought more UK concessions, a string of government resignations followed.\n\nAfter the 2017 general election, which left the Tories severely weakened in parliament, hostility amid their own ranks to any moves towards a \"softer\" Brexit restricted May's room for manoeuvre.\n\nEurosceptics including the DUP strongly opposed her Brexit plan and the subsequent agreement, with many calling for the UK to leave the EU with no deal. In early 2019, the Tories in particular haemorrhaged support to the new hardline Brexit Party.\n\nEqually, several pro-EU MPs also opposed a deal which, in their view, would leave the UK worse off than it had been inside the bloc. Some joined calls from opposition parties for a second referendum. Both the Conservatives and opposition Labour parties suffered defections of some MPs to a new pro-EU centrist party.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAmid the parliamentary deadlock, pressure from Tory Europhiles obliged the prime minister to open the door to a Brexit delay — and engage in cross-party talks, which collapsed after a few weeks.\n\nTheresa May's fate was sealed after she revealed a fourth plan for getting her thrice-rejected Brexit deal through parliament. She tweaked the legislative package and crucially opened the door to a possible confirmatory referendum — a move which angered many in her party and sparked another government resignation.\n\nBrexit delay brings European election electroshock\n\nIn the wake of the repeated parliamentary defeats for the EU divorce deal, the House of Commons twice forced the British government to seek to delay Brexit. In April 2019 EU national leaders met for a special European Council summit and agreed to a six-month \"flexible extension\" to the UK's departure from the bloc, with a new exit date set for October 31 — or earlier if its parliament approved the original withdrawal deal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut relief at avoiding a disruptive no-deal exit was tempered by renewed uncertainty and frustration for businesses and people — especially for EU and UK expats.\n\nThe extension of the UK's EU membership also forced the country to take part in the European Parliament elections in May 2019 — and send 73 newly-elected MEPs to Strasbourg in July.\n\nNigel Farage's new Brexit Party, which advocates leaving the EU without a formal agreement, came top of the European vote. But there was a strong showing from pro-EU parties, in particular, the Liberal Democrats, who wanted to reverse Brexit altogether.\n\nBritain's two main parties — the Conservatives and the Labour opposition — were severely punished by voters. Many Conservatives are furious at the failure to “deliver Brexit”, while Labour was accused of sitting on the fence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe results indicated that opinion in the UK had become still more polarised over Brexit.\n\n'Get Brexit done': PM Johnson launches new drive for EU exit door\n\nThe prolonged period of turmoil in British politics came to a head when Theresa May — who failed to get her EU divorce deal through parliament — became the latest in a long line of Conservative prime ministers to be brought down by Europe.\n\nThe UK's stance towards Brexit took on a distinctly harder edge when Boris Johnson entered Number 10 Downing Street in late July, 2019. The former foreign secretary and London mayor took over the reins after winning the Conservative Party leadership contest.\n\nHe signalled immediately a reinvigorated drive to take the UK out of the EU on October 31 — \"no ifs or buts\" — raising the likelihood that the country would leave the EU without a withdrawal deal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe summer and autumn of 2019 saw the UK government significantly ramp up its no-deal preparations — since stood down — with more funds promised. The Conservative conference in Manchester had a new slogan, “Get Brexit done” — which has echoes of the “take back control” rallying cry of the “Leave” campaign during the 2016 referendum campaign.\n\nThere was further turmoil in the British parliament, where there was stiff opposition to a \"no-deal Brexit\". The government lost numerous votes in the House of Commons, and lost its thin majority. Several Tory rebels were expelled for opposing Brexit strategy.\n\nJohnson suffered a humiliating defeat when the country’s highest court ruled that his government had acted unlawfully by suspending parliament.\n\nIn the end Boris Johnson was forced to compromise over Northern Ireland to win a revised deal. UK law obliged the prime minister to seek a Brexit delay from the EU, which was duly granted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more:Brexit timeline: Boris Johnson's month of turmoil in September 2019\n\nBoris Johnson seals new Brexit deal with EU\n\nOpposition parties granted Boris Johnson his much-sought general election after the threat of an imminent no-deal Brexit in October was overcome.\n\nIn the absence of parliamentary approval for his renegotiated deal by October 19, the prime minister was obliged by law to seek a delay of three months from the European Union.\n\nOn October 29 the European Council President Donald Tusk confirmed that the EU had formally adopted the latest extension of the UK's membership until 31 January 2020 — with the option of an earlier departure if the renegotiated divorce deal was ratified.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe delay put paid to Boris Johnson's vow, repeated many times, that the UK would leave the EU on October 31.\n\nNew Brexit deal is struck — but UK bill is derailed\n\nThe EU and the UK announced on October 17 that they had reached agreement on a revised exit deal. It came on the day of a crucial EU summit and followed a period of intensified talks. The accord was swiftly given the green light by EU national leaders.\n\nThe deal altered previously-negotiated arrangements for Northern Ireland, and envisaged a clearer break for the UK with the EU than the accord struck by Theresa May.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBoris Johnson became prime minister in late July, but it was early October before his government submitted a detailed proposal for a new divorce deal to Brussels. He then threw out its controversial plan for Northern Ireland to reach a compromise.\n\nA bill to implement the new deal passed its first parliamentary hurdle, but was shelved by Johnson himself when MPs rejected the government's fast-track three-day timetable to get it passed. Many felt far more time was needed to scrutinise measures that will determine the UK's relations with Europe for years to come.\n\nRead more:From deal to delay: what happened with Brexit in October 2019?\n\nHow did Johnson reach a revised deal with the EU?\n\nIn a nutshell, Boris Johnson made major concessions over Northern Ireland.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOut went the UK's previous proposals — much vaunted by Brexit supporters — for \"alternative arrangements\" including technological solutions to keep an invisible border. Instead, Johnson has agreed to a different status for Northern Ireland compared to the rest of the UK — accepting a plan very close to one the EU originally proposed.\n\nThe EU also gave ground, re-opening the withdrawal agreement it had always said was sacrosanct. Dublin and Brussels agreed to replace the controversial Irish border backstop that had plagued Brexit talks for months, and opened the door to a possible time-limit on border safeguards with a new consent mechanism.\n\nHowever, Johnson's change of tack came at a price: Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), until then an ally of the government, said it could not support proposals that would create a \"border in the Irish Sea\".\n\nArrangements for Northern Ireland were a key sticking point throughout negotiations ever since the UK triggered the formal Brexit process in March 2017. Behind the details over trading arrangements are fundamental questions concerning identity. The possibility of new borders — between Northern Ireland and either the Irish Republic, or Great Britain, or both — is hugely problematic in a region with a troubled past.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTory election win ends long Brexit deadlock\n\nThe UK finally broke the long-standing Brexit stalemate following the snap general election on December 12, 2019, which brought a crushing victory and 80-seat parliamentary majority for Boris Johnson's ruling Conservative Party.\n\nThe Tories campaigned on a promise to leave the EU by the end of January, and the prime minister's campaign slogan of \"Get Brexit done\" evidently struck a chord with voters. The 80-seat margin provided an ample cushion to put the UK's exit into effect.\n\nThe main opposition Labour Party suffered its biggest defeat since 1935. Under leader Jeremy Corbyn — since replaced by Sir Keir Starmer, the party's former Brexit spokesman — the party's policy was much criticised. Its plan if elected was to renegotiate a Brexit deal which would then have been put to the public in a second referendum.\n\nThe pro-EU Liberal Democrats won fewer than a dozen seats — despite increasing their share of the vote — as the \"Remain\" vote was split. The party's campaign pledge to stop Brexit altogether if elected proved unpopular with voters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Scottish National Party (SNP) which also campaigned to \"stop Brexit\", but via a second public vote, won the vast majority of seats north of the border with England. Across the Irish Sea, anti-Brexit votes also came to the fore as Northern Ireland elected more Irish nationalists to the UK parliament than pro-British unionists.\n\nRead more: The road to Brexit: Boris Johnson's first six months as UK prime minister\n\nJanuary 2020: UK finally leaves the EU\n\nThroughout 2019, the fear for many on both sides of the English Channel was that the UK could \"crash out\" of the EU without an agreed deal on either the terms of the divorce or the future relationship (see 2019 \"No deal revisited\" section below).\n\nBut the threat of such a \"no deal\" exit in January 2020 vanished with the UK election result in December 2019, which saw Boris Johnson's Conservative government re-elected with a large majority.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEU leaders welcomed the \"clarity\" brought about by the election result. Any remaining uncertainty was removed after the divorce deal was ratified by both the British and European parliaments — legal requirements for its terms to take effect.\n\nThe European Parliament passed the deal on January 29, 2020 by a large majority, despite expressing concerns over the rights of Britons living in the EU, and especially the rights of EU citizens resident in the UK.\n\nIn the UK, the Conservatives' election victory ensured that the legislation to implement Brexit was duly passed by parliament, receiving royal assent on January 23.\n\nThe UK went on to leave the EU on Friday, January 31 at midnight CET (11pm UK time) under a ratified divorce agreement. Its provisions on the exit terms — on the financial settlement, citizens' rights, and Northern Ireland — are incorporated into a binding international treaty.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more:\n\nIn pictures: Brexit sparks delight, despair and dissent\n\nMacron: Brexit day is 'historic alarm signal' for reform in Europe\n\nBrexit uncertainty: Study shows 30% rise in UK citizens moving to EU countries since 2016\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n'No-deal' divorce averted\n\nIn the run-up to the UK's anticipated departure from the EU in 2019, many political leaders, institutions, companies and individuals warned that a \"no-deal\" departure would bring severe disruption and economic damage on both sides of the English Channel — with the UK being hit worse than the EU.\n\nHowever, Brexiteers dismissed “Project Fear” forecasts and some argued that the UK could survive perfectly well under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.\n\nGovernment documents, published in early September 2019 and codenamed \"Operation Yellowhammer\", confirmed a grim assessment of the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on October 31. Based on the government's own preparations for a \"worst case\" scenario, they contained warnings of possible food, medicine and fuel shortages.\n\nThe heightened uncertainty amid a year of British political turmoil in 2019 twice forced the UK and the EU — as well as people and businesses on both sides of the English Channel — to step up no-deal preparations, as the Brexit process dragged on without formal approval for an exit deal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more:Why I'm excited to do business in Brexit Britain as an EU entrepreneur | View\n\nTheresa May's government had published a series of papers — some updated under her successor — advising UK citizens and businesses on the consequences and how to prepare for no-deal. It said the EU would treat the UK as a \"third country\".\n\nBritish economic sectors reliant on close, smooth arrangements with Europe warned of the dangers of new costs and restrictions being imposed overnight. Among those sounding alarm bells were manufacturing industries — including the car industry, food and drink, chemicals and pharmaceuticals – as well as aviation, the health service, tourism, and financial services. There were also warnings over farming and fishing — despite strong support for Brexit from within these two sectors.\n\nIn August 2019, after the Bank of England lowered its growth forecast for the UK post-Brexit, its governor Mark Carney warned that in the event of no deal the economy would suffer an instant hit, prices would rise and the pound would fall, and even large profitable industries would become \"uneconomic\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn April 2019, a leaked letter by the government's most senior civil servant warned of an economic recession, food price rises, a severe impact on Britain's security services, police forces and legal system, and a return to direct rule by the UK government in Northern Ireland. In early August a leaked government document contained similar warnings.\n\nIn November 2018, two major reports by the UK Treasury and the Bank of England assessed the potential damage to the British economy of various Brexit scenarios.\n\nIn an assessment of EU preparations for no-deal published in July 2019, the UK House of Commons Library described the Commission's programme as one of \"damage limitation\" to protect the EU27 countries.\n\nRead more: What would 'WTO terms' have meant for UK-EU trade?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPost-Brexit talks: The struggle to agree the future UK-EU relationship\n\nFollowing the UK's departure from the bloc in January 2020 under the terms of the divorce deal, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team were granted a new mandate from the European Council — made up of national leaders from the EU27 countries — to negotiate the post-Brexit EU-UK relationship. The UK under Boris Johnson's new government also set out its position.\n\nThe negotiations which began in March 2020 were based on the principles set out in the Political Declaration (see above), the non-binding part of the Brexit divorce deal. The talks covered trade in goods, plus a wide range of other areas including services, fishing and farming, aviation, security cooperation, data policy, education and science.\n\nAn agreement needed to be ready to come into effect when the transition period expired at the end of December. In practice a series of missed deadlines as the process dragged on meant there was no longer enough time for a conventional ratification process and for both sides to get ready for January 1, 2021.\n\nMonths of negotiations brought slow progress and no breakthrough on key issues: competition, fisheries and governance (a mechanism for dispute settlement and enforcement). Both sides’ red lines meant they were staring at a potential economic no-deal \"cliff-edge\" as 2020 neared its end — until finally a deal was struck on Christmas Eve.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat would 'no-deal' on trade and future ties have meant in practice?\n\nThe \"no deal\" talked about throughout 2020 referred not to the terms of the UK's exit from the EU — but to the potential failure to reach agreement on trade and future ties by the end of the 11-month transition period.\n\nWithout an agreement on the future relationship, barriers to trade and other aspects of life between the EU and the UK would have been aggravated.\n\nBoris Johnson said \"a trading arrangement with the EU like Australia’s... would be a good outcome for the UK\". Australia however has no trade deal with the EU. After the trade talks breakthrough on December 24, Johnson lauded a 'Canada-style' agreement with the EU — although the reality is somewhat different.\n\nWith no deal, the EU and the UK would have had to trade on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, bringing tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Here, each member must grant the same market access to all other members – except developing countries and those that have free trade agreements.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe friction that will result anyway as a result of the UK's exit from the EU's trading structures would have been aggravated by the absence of a trade deal. This would have hit the UK's economy but also those of its closest continental neighbours — and Ireland.\n\nOther important matters such as cooperation on security and terrorism, education and science risked being left up in the air if no detailed agreement had been reached on future EU-UK relations.\n\nWhat did each side want from post-Brexit ties?\n\nThe UK sought a free trade deal with maximum independence from EU rules. The EU's priority is to protect the integrity of its projects and to ensure the UK has no unfair competitive advantage in the future.\n\nEuropean Union leaders called at the outset of the negotiations for an “ambitious” wide-ranging agreement — subject to conditions. The EU wanted one comprehensive treaty covering everything, whereas the United Kingdom sought a simpler free trade deal and separate agreements on other matters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBoris Johnson’s nationalist government — with no allies among the EU27 countries over Brexit — was seeking a far more distant, independent relationship with the EU than the one sought under the previous UK prime minister, Theresa May.\n\nAnd though Johnson described the new deal as \"Canada-style\", Brussels had always stressed that the UK’s geographical proximity to the EU, and degree of economic integration with Europe, meant the same rules cannot apply.\n\nAlthough the talks involved elaborate technical detail, both sides had over-arching political objectives. The UK wanted to make sure its European ties did not compromise its new independence; the EU needed to show that life inside the bloc is better than outside, and consistently said the UK could not \"cherry-pick\" benefits without obligations.\n\nDeadlock over competition and fishing rights\n\nThese were the bane of the negotiations and looked for a long time like they were impossible to resolve. Throughout the talks, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier repeatedly said the UK had failed to engage on a commitment to respect the \"level playing field\" in competition, while his British counterpart effectively accused Brussels of moving the goalposts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKey sticking points included EU access to UK fishing waters and state subsidies.\n\nThe EU wanted to ensure that British firms could not undercut the bloc’s environmental or workplace standards. It was also determined to make a trade deal conditional on securing agreement on \"state aid\" rules, to prevent the UK from distorting competition by pumping public money into domestic industries.\n\nBarnier's British counterpart David Frost had previously accused Brussels of unfairly trying to tie the UK into EU rules and standards, arguing that EU demands on fishing were incompatible with UK sovereignty.\n\nThe EU chief negotiator was equally disparaging over the UK's stance on matters such as governance, law enforcement, transport and sustainable development — adding that the British seemed to misunderstand the consequences of leaving the EU's Single Market and Customs Union.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOver transport rights, Barnier criticised London for wanting certain rules such as driving time and rest periods to be waived for British lorry-drivers while on European roads, but for access to be the same as that granted to workers from EU member states.\n\nTrade talks timeline: Months of stalemate on future EU-UK ties\n\nBoth sides outlined sharply contrasting positions as they flexed their muscles in advance of the talks. Setting out the EU's position, Michel Barnier said there could be no trade deal unless Britain agreed to the \"level playing field\" commitment and did not undercut EU regulations.\n\nBut during the pre-talks period Johnson, other ministers and officials, all highlighted the UK's stance: that being able to diverge from EU rules and standards was the essence of Brexit and the UK’s “new footing as an independent sovereign nation”.\n\nCoronavirus puts a spanner in the works\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA first round of talks in March was followed by a six-week suspension amid the coronavirus outbreak, which totally overshadowed the process as it developed into a full pandemic. Key figures including Barnier and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson were struck at various stages by COVID-19.\n\nThree further rounds took place by video link instead of face-to-face talks, a step seen as necessary but unsatisfactory given the detail involved and the dozens of negotiators on each side.\n\nAt each stage, both sides expressed frustration at the lack of progress. At the end of the second round of talks in April, Barnier effectively accused the UK of dragging its feet.\n\nHe used similar language at the end of a third round of discussions in mid-May, accusing the UK in a speech of a lack of ambition. His British counterpart David Frost agreed that little progress had been made, accusing the EU of adopting an ideological approach.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter the fourth round in early June, the EU negotiator's language was starker than ever. Barnier said no significant progress had been made towards a deal, accusing the UK of backtracking on commitments. Frost said progress had been \"limited\" and regretted the remote format.\n\nIn June 2020, both sides agreed to intensify talks over the summer, after extremely sluggish progress during the first few months of negotiations.\n\nBut after further talks ended in early July, the EU's chief negotiator again said that \"serious divergences remain\", while his British counterpart used the phrase \"significant differences\".\n\nAlthough large differences remained on fundamental issues such as competition and fishing rights, late July brought signs that both the UK and EU are willing to compromise in some areas -- leading to hope that a deal could be struck.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut optimism was short-lived: after a seventh round of talks in August brought \"little progress\", Barnier complained that \"we are wasting valuable time\".\n\nIn early SeptemberBoris Johnson threatened to walk away from the talks if no breakthrough was achieved by the time of an EU summit in mid-October. The beginning of that month saw both sides using similar language to describe the ongoing stalemate, despite \"positive developments\" in some areas.\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said after the fruitless EU summit on October 15 that Britain was now preparing for no-deal unless there was a significant change of approach from the EU.\n\nThe tone subsequently turned more conciliatory: Barnier said agreement was \"within reach\" if both sides compromised and talks resumed amid a media blackout. However, serious differences remained as another round ended in early November.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter many missed deadlines the two sides continued to negotiate right through December, even though time had run out for a conventional ratification process.\n\nTransition extension is ruled out\n\nThe divorce agreement allowed for a two-year extension of the transition period to give more time for negotiation, with an end-of-June deadline for a decision on whether to invoke it. Both sides have agreed however that there will be no prolongation, the EU having accepted the UK's opposition to it.\n\nDespite the coronavirus pandemic, Britain consistently ruled out any extension having legislated to that effect.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome voices had called on the UK to seek an extension: they included the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kristalina Georgieva, the European Parliament's largest group the European People's Party, and the anti-Brexit campaign group Best for Britain.\n\nCritics said the shorter deadline provided nowhere near enough time to conclude a deal embracing all aspects of future EU-UK relations. One possibility evoked was for a simpler, more “bare-bones” trade deal to be struck, leaving the detail of other policy areas to be sorted out later.\n\nUK plan to breach EU divorce deal\n\nIn September 2020 the Johnson government sparked a furore with its bombshell UK Internal Market Bill, further souring UK-EU relations, casting a shadow over the talks on future ties. The EU launched legal action.\n\nThe bill contained measures which would have overriden sections of the Northern Ireland Protocol — part of the UK-EU divorce deal that has the force of international law (see Brexit Divorce Deal section below). The British prime minister described the bill as a legal \"safety net\" to protect the UK's integrity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn December 8, 2020 the UK said it had agreed to withdraw the contentious measures when agreement was struck with the EU on implementing the arrangements for Northern Ireland contained in the divorce deal.\n\nHowever, the episode raised fundamental questions over trust — and reinforced EU resolve to ensure that a deal on future relations included a robust mechanism to enforce it.\n\nFinally, with just a week to go before a \"no-deal scenario\" would have seen the UK crash out of the EU's Single Market and Customs Union without an agreement, a deal was struck on Christmas Eve 2020.\n\nThe Trade and Future Cooperation Agreement (TCA) was quickly approved by EU national leaders and the UK parliament. It came into force provisionally on January 1, 2021, and was later ratified by the European Parliament in April.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPOSTSCRIPT: How does the European Union work?\n\nThe EU originally developed after World War Two, with the aim of promoting economic co-operation and trade between countries to stop them from going to war again.

He and his family have argued that Fitton, 66, had no criminal intent.\n\n“I thought the worst case scenario would be one year, with suspension,” Fitton’s lawyer Thair Soud, visibly shocked, told The Associated Press.\n\nSoud said Fitton would appeal the verdict.\n\nA German national tried with Fitton was found not to have had criminal intent in the case and will be released.\n\nJudge Jabir Abd Jabir found that, according to the government's investigation, Fitton had criminal intent to smuggle the artifacts that he had picked up and intended to transport them out of the country.\n\nLibyan artifacts:US returns smuggled ancient artifacts, some thousands of years old, to Libya\n\nThe trial has grabbed international attention at a time when Iraq seeks to open up its nascent tourism sector. The two men first appeared in court on May 15 wearing yellow detainees' uniforms, telling judges they had not acted with criminal intent and had no idea they might have broken local laws.\n\nFitton said he “suspected” the items he collected were ancient fragments, but that “at the time I didn’t know about Iraqi laws,” or that taking the shards was not permitted. Fitton said as geologist he was in the habit of collecting such fragments as a hobby and had no intention to sell them.\n\nIn his defense, Soud said Fitton waited for weeks while in custody before hiring him as his legal counsel, arguing that this makes the point that the Briton had no idea of the severity of the case or the value of the goods found in his possession.\n\nThe judge, however, did not consider Soud’s arguments that laid out Fitton’s ignorance of Iraqi laws and the value of the items he picked up. Fitton and the German national, Volker Waldman, were arrested at Baghdad's airport on March 20 after airport security discovered the items in their luggage. They had been part of a tourism expedition around the country’s ancient sites.\n\nVideo:S.S. Central America Artifacts\n\nTheir tour guide, also a British citizen who was in his 80s and in poor health, died in police custody for reasons unrelated to his detention. He was found with over 20 archaeological fragments in this possession.\n\nFitton’s family grew worried when he did not arrive on a scheduled flight back to Kuala Lumpur, where he resides with his wife, on March 20. They later learned that Fitton, a well-traveled geologist for oil and gas companies, had been taken to an airport holding cell where he was still being detained, Fitton’s daughter Leila told The Associated Press last month.\n\nFitton missed his daughter's wedding in Malaysia, which took place in early May. Leila said at the time she was “heartbroken” by his absence.\n\nHer hope for her father's return home has been a near-daily fixture on her social media. Nineteen hours before Fitton was sentence she posted a photo of her parents to mark their wedding anniversary. In another, at a family hiking trip she wrote she hoped her father would be able to join them on the next venture.\n\nFrustrated by perceived inaction on the part of the British Foreign Office to intervene and assist in Fitton’s case, his family started a petition that has garnered over 100,000 signatures. The British diplomatic mission in Baghdad has not commented on its involvement in the case and the British consul in Iraq, who attended the court session Monday, left following the sentencing without making any comments.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?:Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nIn total, 12 fragments of pottery and other shards were found in Fitton’s possession by Iraqi authorities, all of them collected as souvenirs, Fitton’s family says, during a group tourism expedition to Eridu, an ancient Mesopotamian site in what is now Dhi Qar province. The site is said to be among the oldest sites belonging to that civilization.\n\nControversy, however, remains about the items that Fitton had picked up. A report by the Iraqi Culture Ministry stated they were over 200 years old, without offering any further explanation about their provenance. But any item less than 1,500 years old disqualifies it from being from antiquity, a period from the beginnings of Western civilization to about 450 A.D.\n\nThe trial has also divided Iraqi public opinion. Some see the punishment as just, saying Iraq has long been a looting ground for invaders and foreigners with impunity. Others said Iraq lacked proper site management to inform tourists of the laws.\n\nMore:Museums must return stolen artifacts, experts say. That requires an 'institutional transformation.'\n\n“Eridu is a UNESCO world heritage site in Iraq and it requires a better site management plan,” said Ali Makhzomy, the founder of BilWeekend, a touring company. “It is the Iraqi government's responsibility to do that.\"\n\nThe items were not shown in court. Amir Abdul Razaq, an archaeologist in the southern province of Nassriyah, said he believed the items in Fitton's possession dated back to 1,800 B.C. after The Associated Press shared images of the shards shared by his family. Government officials could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nWaldman’s defense team has said the German tourist had been carrying two pieces for Fitton but that he did not pick them up from the site. Both men were charged with smuggling based on the country’s antiquities laws, and could have potentially faced the death penalty. However, officials had said that was only a remote possibility.\n\nIt wasn't clear if Fitton can serve out his sentence in his home country.

He apparently collected them with the blessing of his tour guide, Geoff Hann, who later died in police custody, and under the gaze of representatives from the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage (SBAH) and local police.\n\nNormally, the punishment for acquiring a few shards of pottery from an ancient site is a fine. But Fitton was found guilty under a 2002 law that carries a sentence of seven to 15 years in prison for stealing artefacts or antiquities; at the time of writing he is still in prison (he has lodged an appeal which will be heard in the next month). The SBAH declined to comment.\n\nFitton’s family have not been able to communicate with him since he was moved from the airport jail into the Rusafa Prison in Baghdad after sentencing. Leila Fitton says: “We are calling on the foreign secretary [Liz Truss] and junior ministers within FCDO [Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office] to communicate with us directly, to stop hiding behind civil servants and copy-pasted press statements, and to publicly come out in support of my father and acknowledge the injustice of the situation.”\n\nForeign archaeologists work at a site in the ancient city of Eridu near Nassiriya, Iraq REUTERS/Alaa Al-Marjani\n\nForeign tourists had started flocking to ancient sites again after Iraq introduced a new visa scheme last year. But could the harsh sentence imposed on Fitton stop the source of foreign income in its tracks?\n\nWhile antiquities tourism was lucrative in the 1970s and 80s, it was diminished considerably by 12 years of stringent United Nations sanctions and then by violence during and after the Iraq War. The Iraqi government shut down some fledgling foreign travel companies offering tours from 2004 to 2010, but a few reopened soon after that.\n\nThe current Iraqi government has primarily been concerned with the repatriation of looted objects, such as the prized 3,500-year-old Gilgamesh tablet, which was one of more than 18,000 artefacts that were returned last year, mostly from the US.\n\n“The sentencing [of Fitton] is extremely harsh” Ihab Zaki, owner of Spiekermann Travel\n\nThere is much speculation about what might have prompted such harsh action against Fitton. Some insiders see it as a political act, a nationalist play to the crowd disguised as a warning to tourists but really aimed at the domestic audience.\n\n“The sentencing [of Fitton] is extremely harsh—especially because he’s obviously not involved in the illicit trade of antiquities,” says Ihab Zaki, the owner of Spiekermann Travel, who is based in Detroit. Zaki has been running bi-annual luxury coach tours of Iraqi heritage sites since 2012.\n\nWhether intentional or not, “it was a stupid move”, Zaki says, “on the part of Fitton but especially on the part of the Iraqi authorities”. Zaki’s autumn tour of heritage sites is already half full, and his business has yet to be affected by Fitton’s conviction, but he is concerned about the general effect this could have on tourism.\n\n“The Iraqi government needs to seek international expertise in tourism management and invest in infrastructure, such as clear signage in foreign languages, hotlines, etc. if they want to attract more visitors,” he says.\n\nThe archaeologist Tobin Hartnell, who will accompany Zaki’s autumn tour, says that “the industry is professionalising after decades of instability, and there are going to be misunderstandings along the way”. He adds: “The best advice for tourists is to respect the local laws which define an antiquity as anything older than 150 years and think twice before putting anything, even broken pottery, in their bag to take home.”\n\nZaki hopes that Fitton will be “released immediately—perhaps just with a fine and an apology”. He also hopes that the incident will not deter future visitors “to one of the world’s oldest civilisations”, calling cultural tourism a form of “soft diplomacy” that ideally “increases understanding between Iraq and the West”.\n\nIraq’s culture minister, Hassan Nadhem, meanwhile told the New York Times: “We support any kind of legal action against those who try to steal and smuggle artefacts.” He added that looting at archaeological sites has been a major problem in Iraq.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/06/07/british-tourist-iraqi-jail-sentence-artifacts/", "title": "British geologist gets Iraq prison term for taking artifacts - The ...", "text": "A Baghdad court has sentenced a British tourist to 15 years in prison for taking pottery shards from the archaeological site of an ancient city in southeast Iraq. Jim Fitton, a 66-year-old retired geologist, was convicted of trying to smuggle artifacts out of the country after his arrest at Baghdad’s airport with several fragments and stones in his luggage. The British citizen and his family have maintained that he did not know this was illegal and that the shards were in an open, unguarded location when he picked them up.\n\nThe ruling on Monday shook Fitton’s family, and his lawyer told reporters he would appeal.\n\n“We could not be more heartbroken and shellshocked,” his daughter, Leila, wrote in an online petition for his release, describing the sentence as a “horrific injustice.” “We are suspending our emotional reactions in favor of positive action to get Jim home,” the statement from his family added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with a tour group visiting Iraq earlier this year, Fitton went to the archaeological site of Eridu, part of the remains of Sumerian cities in ancient Mesopotamia.\n\nHis family has urged the British government to intervene and endorse the appeal.\n\nThe British Foreign Office said Tuesday in an email that it was “in contact with the local authorities” but did not respond to questions about the verdict or about whether Fitton could serve the sentence in his home country instead of Iraq. “We are providing consular assistance to a British national in Iraq, and continue to support his family,” it said.\n\nUnder a 2002 heritage law in Iraq, looting artifacts can lead to a prison sentence of seven to 15 years, while stealing antiquities by force with weapons or in a group is punishable by the death penalty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe country, home to the proverbial cradle of civilization, has seen a push to recover thousands of ancient artifacts that were plundered in the two decades since the U.S. invasion — many of which ended up in museums and personal collections in the United States and around the world.\n\nThe neglect of archaeological sites, lack of funds and corruption later enabled further looting, while Islamic State militants notoriously destroyed and smuggled antiquities when they held territory in Iraq.\n\nLast year, the United States handed back more than 17,000 smuggled artifacts, as the Iraqi culture minister praised international efforts to stop smugglers and return looted possessions.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Iraqi government on Fitton’s prison sentence on Monday, which appeared to shock his lawyer. “I thought the worst-case scenario would be one year, with suspension,” the lawyer told the Associated Press.", "authors": ["Ellen Francis"], "publish_date": "2022/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/iraqi-court-sentences-uk-citizen-to-15-years-in-jail-for-smuggling-artifacts/", "title": "Iraqi court sentences UK citizen to 15 years in jail for smuggling ..."}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/briton-sentenced-15-years-iraq-smuggling-artifacts-2022-06-06/", "title": "Briton sentenced to 15 years in Iraq for smuggling artifacts | Reuters"}]}

It also contains information about notable kings and queens and a timeline of Queen Elizabeth’s own life.\n\nThe UK government reportedly awarded a £12m contract to London-based publisher DK books to produce 211,000 bilingual copies of the book to be distributed to children at just under 3,000 schools and educational establishments in Wales.\n\nBut after seeing early pages, members of the Welsh government felt it would not be appropriate to distribute it to every pupil.\n\nInstead they asked in March to leave it to schools to request their copies. It has been described as having taken an Anglocentric line that did not give due regard to the history of the devolved countries of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nGovernment ministers were said to be dismayed at the Welsh government’s initial reaction to their plans, especially as the book covers how the four nations came together as one United Kingdom, including some pages on Owain Glyndwr’s Welsh rebellion against the English in 1400 to take the title of ‘Prince of Wales’.\n\nThe book tracks British history through the memories of great granny Joyce.

Unbeknownst to most people, the state of California was named after Calafia, a fictional Black queen who ruled over a mythic all-female (perhaps lesbian) island of Black women just off the coast of Asia. She used an army of flying griffins to fight Christians at Constantinople and has become an interesting yet little known literary figure ever since. In 1530, when Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés arrived on what is now known as Baja California on Mexico’s west coast, he named the land “California,” after Calafia’s island in Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo’s book.\n\n1663, UK\n\nEnglish politician Samuel Pepys writes in his diary of his displeasure at how common sodomy had become in the country’s military.\n\n1670, France\n\nJulie d’Aubigny (1670/1673-1707), better known as Mademoiselle Maupin or La Maupin, was a word-slinger, opera singer, and larger-than-life bisexual 17th-century celebrity opera singer. Little is known about her life; her tumultuous career and flamboyant lifestyle were the subject of gossip, rumor, and colorful stories in her own time, and inspired numerous fictional and semi-fictional portrayals afterwards. Gautier loosely based the title character, Madeleine de Maupin, of his novel Mademoiselle de Maupin (1835) on her. The celebration of sensual love, regardless of gender, was radical, and the book was banned by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice and authorities elsewhere. Mademoiselle Maupin retired from the opera in 1705 and took refuge in a convent, probably in Provence, where she is believed to have died on July 1, 1707, at the age of 33.\n\n1828, UK – The Buggery Act is repealed then reenacted, criminalizing sodomy.\n\n1925\n\nFarley Granger (July 1, 1925 – March 27, 2011) is born. He was an American actor, best known for his two collaborations with director Alfred Hitchcock. In 2007, Granger published the memoir Include Me Out, co-written with domestic partner Robert Calhoun (November 24, 1930 – May 24, 2008). In the book, named after one of Goldwyn’s famous malapropisms, he freely discusses his career and personal life.\n\n1928\n\nThe lesbian novel The Well of Loneliness by the British author Radclyffe Hall (August 12, 1880 – October 7, 1943) was published on this date in the United States and sold an initial 20,000 copies. It follows the life of Stephen Gordon, an Englishwoman from an upper-class family whose “sexual inversion” (homosexuality) is apparent from an early age. She finds love with Mary Llewellyn whom she meets while serving as an ambulance driver in World War I, but their happiness together is marred by social isolation and rejection, which Hall depicts as typically suffered by “inverts” with predictably debilitating effects. The novel portrays inversion as a natural, God-given state and makes an explicit plea: “Give us also the right to our existence.” In 1915, Hall fell in love with Una Troubridge (1887–1963), a sculptor with whom she lived at 37 Holland Street, Kensington, London. The relationship would last until Hall’s death, though in 1934 Hall fell in love with Russian émigré Evguenia Souline and embarked upon a long-term affair with her which Troubridge painfully tolerated.\n\n1934\n\nHollywood makes adherence to the Hays Code mandatory. It was named after for Will H. Hays who was the president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) from 1922 to 1945. Among its provisions: “Pictures shall not infer that low forms of sex relationships are the accepted or common thing,” and “Sex perversion or any inference to it is forbidden on the screen.” The Motion Picture Production Code was the set of industry moral guidelines that was applied to most United States motion pictures released by major studios from 1930 to 1968. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) adopted the Production Code in 1930 and began strictly enforcing it in 1934. The Production Code spelled out what was acceptable and what was unacceptable content for motion pictures produced for a public audience in the United States. Hays, who was Postmaster General under Warren G. Harding and former head of the Republican National Committee, served for 25 years as president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA).\n\n1943, Netherlands\n\nWillem Arondeus (August 22, 1894 – July 1, 1943) dies. He was a Dutch artist and author who joined the Dutch anti-Nazi resistance movement during World War II. He participated in the bombing of the Amsterdam public records office to hinder the Nazi German effort to identify Dutch Jews. Arondeus was caught and executed by the Nazis soon after his arrest along with tailor Sjoerd Bakker and writer Johan Brouwer who also were gay and 10 others. Arondeus was openly gay before the war and defiantly asserted his sexuality before his execution. The last wish of Arondeus is that he be given a pink shirt. He declares: “Let it be known that homosexuals are not cowards.”\n\n1947\n\nU.S. Congress discontinues the military “Blue Discharges” with two new classifications: general and undesirable. The Army then changes its regulations so that gay and lesbian service members would not qualify for general discharges. The U.S. military had a long-standing policy that service members found to be homosexual or to have engaged in homosexual conduct were to be court-martialed for sodomy, imprisoned and dishonorably discharged. However, with the mobilization of troops following the United States’ entry into World War II, it became impractical to convene court-martial boards of commissioned officers so some commanders began issuing administrative discharges instead. Several waves of reform addressing the handling of homosexuals in the military resulted in a 1944 policy directive that called for homosexuals to be committed to military hospitals, examined by psychiatrists, and discharged under Regulation 615-360, Section 8 as “unfit for service.” It is unknown exactly how many gay and lesbian service members were given blue discharges under this regulation, but in 1946 the Army estimated that it had issued between 49,000 and 68,000 blue discharges, with approximately 5,000 of them issued to homosexuals. The Navy’s estimates of blue-discharge homosexuals was around 4,000. Blue discharges were discontinued as of July 1, 1947 when the two new headings of general and undesirable took their place. A general discharge was considered to be under honorable conditions—distinct from an “honorable discharge”—and an undesirable discharge was under conditions other than honorable—distinct from a “dishonorable discharge.” At the same time, the Army changed its regulations to ensure that gay and lesbian service members would not qualify for general discharges. Those found guilty of engaging in homosexual conduct still received dishonorable discharges, while those identified as homosexuals but not to have committed any homosexual acts now received undesirable discharges.\n\n1962\n\nDr. Alan Hart (October 4, 1890 – July 1, 1962) dies. Historian Jonathan Ned Katz explains that Stanford University graduate Lucille Hart changed her name and lived as a man in order to practice medicine and marry the women he loved. The first was Inez Stark in 1918 and then, after their 1925 divorce, Edna Ruddick, to whom he stayed married until his death 37 years later.\n\n1969\n\nIn Norton v. Macy, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rules that the termination of a National Aeronautics and Space Administration employee for “immoral conduct” relating to his alleged homosexual conduct was unlawful.\n\n1970\n\nThe Task Force on Gay Liberation forms within the American Library Association. Now known as the GLBT Round Table, this organization is the oldest LGBT professional organization in the United States. On July 1st at the ALA Annual Conference in Detroit, MI, the Task Force on Gay Liberation meets for the first time. Israel Fishman serves as the first coordinator of the group. A social and “consciousness-raising event” was held with members of the Detroit Gay Liberation Front. Initial goals of the group included the creation of bibliographies, revision of library classification schemes and subject headings, building and improving access to collections, and fighting job discrimination. Barbara Gittings (July 31, 1932 – February 18, 2007) puts together a list of 37 gay-positive books, magazine articles, and pamphlets – the first version of a resource that would become known as A Gay Bibliography.\n\n1971, Canada\n\nThe founding meetings of the Gay Alliance Toward Equality (GATE) are held in Vancouver. It is the first Canadian group to talk about civil rights strategies.\n\n1971\n\nThe Furies Collective House at 219 11th St SE in Washington, D.C. was the operational center of the Furies, a lesbian feminist separatist collective from July 1, 1971 to 1973. The work done by the Furies here, including publication of their newspaper, The Furies, was instrumental in creating and shaping the ideas that continue to underpin lesbian feminism and lesbian separatism. The Furies, along with the Gay Liberation House and the Skyline Collective, was among Washington, D.C.’s best known communal living groups in the early 1970s. They were an example of lesbian feminism which emerged during the women’s movement of the late 1960s and 1970s. According to Rita Mae Brown in Rita Will, the members of the collective were Rita Mae Brown, Charlotte Bunch, Tasha Byrd Peterson, Ginny Berson, Sharon Deevey, Susan Hathaway, Lee Schwing, Helaine Harris, Coletta Reid, Jennifer Woodul, Nancy Myron and Joan E. Biren (J.E.B.) In 2016 the house at 219 11th St. SE was named as the first lesbian-related historic landmark in Washington, D.C.\n\n1971, Austria\n\nThe Parliament rescinds laws against sex between consenting adults but adds legislation penalizing individuals who make public statements or join organizations that favor homosexuality. Although the new legislation is used to harass lesbians and gay men and, later, to prevent the import of gay and lesbian pornography, including safer sex literature, no individuals or organizations are successfully prosecuted under the laws.\n\n1972, UK\n\nThe United Kingdom’s first Gay Pride March draws about 2,000 gay men and lesbians to the center of London.\n\n1972\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate George McGovern endorses gay rights, the first U.S. presidential candidate in history to do so; party stalwarts denounce him.\n\n1975, Mexico\n\nLesbian activists at the first United Nations World Conference on Women come to the attention of the world press when Pedro Gringoire attacks their efforts to make lesbian rights part of the conference agenda in an essay published in Excelsior, the country’s leading newspaper. Gringoire calls lesbianism a “pathological irregularity,” a “sexual aberration,” and a “severe illness.” Lesbian activists score gains in visibility as a result but fail to elicit an official response to their demands at the conference.\n\n1975\n\nCalifornia and Washington decriminalize private consensual adult homosexual acts. Indiana does so the following year.\n\n1975\n\nA gay rights group called Gay American Indians is launched in San Francisco by Randy Burns and Barbara May Cameron. It was initially launched as a safe place to socialize and share. It was the first gay American Indian liberation organization.\n\n1975\n\nBlue Boy magazine debuts. It was a gay pornographic/lifestyle magazine with pictures of men in various states of undress from 1974 to 2007. It was published by Donald N. Embinder, a former advertising representative for After Dark, an arts magazine with a substantial gay readership. Embinder first used the nom de plume Don Westbrook but soon assumed his real name on the masthead.\n\n1976\n\nHaaz Sleiman (born July 1, 1976) is a Lebanese-American television and film actor. He most notably played the role of Tarek in the 2007 film The Visitor and the role of Jesus in the American TV mini-series Killing Jesus, in addition to a number of American TV series. On August 22, 2017 Sleiman came out as gay via a Facebook video.\n\n1979\n\nThe Susan B. Anthony dollar makes its debut. While there were many complaints about the coin, it was mostly because it was nearly the same size as a quarter, not that it was the first U.S. coin to feature the likeness of a lesbian. Susan Brownell Anthony (February 15, 1820 – March 13, 1906) was an American social reformer and women’s rights activist who played a pivotal role in the women’s suffrage movement. Born into a Quaker family committed to social equality, she collected anti-slavery petitions at the age of 17. In 1856, she became the New York state agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society. In 1851, she met Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who became her lifelong friend and co-worker in social reform activities, primarily in the field of women’s rights. In 1852, they founded the New York Women’s State Temperance Society after Anthony was prevented from speaking at a temperance conference because she was female. In 1863, they founded the Women’s Loyal National League which conducted the largest petition drive in United States history up to that time, collecting nearly 400,000 signatures in support of the abolition of slavery. In 1866, they initiated the American Equal Rights Association which campaigned for equal rights for both women and African Americans. The Nineteenth Amendment, which guaranteed the right of women to vote, was popularly known as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. Historian Lillian Faderman (July 18, 1940) suggests that Susan B. Anthony may have had relationships with Anna Dickinson, Rachel Avery and Emily Gross at different times in her life. Her niece Lucy Anthony was a life partner of suffrage leader and Methodist minister Anna Howard Shaw.\n\n1986\n\nRenowned science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke (December 16, 1917 – March 19, 2008) comes very close to coming out in an interview published in Playboy magazine. When Clarke was asked if he’s had bisexual experiences, he responded, “Of course! Who hasn’t?” He is perhaps most famous for being co-writer of the screenplay for the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, widely considered to be one of the most influential films of all time.\n\n1987\n\nPresident Reagan nominates openly homophobic Robert Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court. The nomination is rejected by the U.S. Senate for a wide variety of reasons.\n\n1989\n\nProfessional body builder Bob Paris (December 14, 1959) comes out in an interview in Ironman magazine. He is an American writer, actor, public speaker, civil rights activist and former professional bodybuilder. Paris was the 1983 NPC American National and IFBB World Bodybuilding Champion Mr. Universe. He was the world’s first male professional athlete, in any sport, to come out in the media while still an active competitor in his sport. The same year, Paris appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show discussing marriage and being gay. Oprah asked Paris, “Bob, why not just stay in the closet?” Paris explained how “you fall in love” and that it doesn’t feel right to hide it. Paris and his former boyfriend at the time, Rod Jackson, became symbols for gay marriage and advocated for gay rights. Paris’s career ended up suffering because he came out; he claims his life was even threatened through mail and by phone. Paris lost about 80% of his bookings and endorsements for bodybuilding. Today, Paris lives with his spouse Brian LeFurgey on an island near Vancouver, British Columbia. Together since 1996, Bob and Brian were legally married in British Columbia after the province equalized the marriage laws in 2003.\n\n2000\n\nVermont begins performing civil unions for same-sex couples. Still not equivalent to marriages (and not recognized by the federal government or by other states or countries), these are nonetheless the first relationships in the U.S. to receive this level of legal recognition.\n\n2006\n\nFlorida Republican gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist’s (July 24, 1956) campaign ads were carefully worded to include his support of “traditional marriage.” Media stories throughout the campaign claimed that Crist is gay. He is the U.S. Representative for Florida’s 13th congressional district. He had previously served as the 44th Governor of Florida from 2007 to 2011. In January 2014, Crist apologized for his support for the 2008 same-sex marriage ban and for the same-sex adoption ban, telling an Orlando LGBT publication that “I’m sorry I did that. It was a mistake. I was wrong. Please forgive me. On May 9, 2013, Crist announced that he supports same-sex marriage; “I most certainly support marriage equality in Florida and look forward to the day it happens here.” In both 2006 and 2008, Crist announced his support for the Federal Marriage Amendment. By 2010, he had endorsed adoption rights for gay couples.\n\n2009, Hungary\n\nRegistered partnerships go into effect.\n\n2010, Denmark\n\nDenmark allows same sex couples to apply jointly for adoptions.\n\n2020, Poland\n\nLGBT Free Zone stickers distributed by the Gazeta Polska newspaper in Poland. The Warsaw district court ordered that distribution of LGBT-free zone stickers should halt pending the resolution of a court case. However, Gazeta Polska’s editor dismissed the ruling saying it was “fake news” and censorship, and that the paper would continue distributing the stickers. Gazeta continued distribution of the stickers but modified the decal to read “LGBT ideology-Free Zone.”\n\nJuly 2\n\n1899, UK\n\nActor Charles Laughton is born in Scaborough, England. Laughton (July 1, 1899 – December 15, 1962) was an English stage and film character actor, director, producer and screenwriter. Not blessed with matinee idol looks, Laughton built a brilliant career as a character actor and still earned his fair share of male lovers. His wife Elsa Lanchester (October 28, 1902 – December 26, 1986) was a British-born American actress with a long career in theatre, film and television. Elsa knew all about Charles’ boys. In her biography of Laughton she was candid and loving in her descriptions of his affairs.\n\n1951\n\nSylvia Rivera (July 2, 1951 – February 19, 2002) was an American gay liberation and transgender activist and self-identified drag queen. She was a founding member of both the Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activists Alliance. With her close friend Marsha P. Johnson (August 24, 1945 – July 6, 1992), Rivera co-founded the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR), a group dedicated to helping homeless young drag queens and trans women of color. Rivera’s gender identity was complex and varied throughout her life. In 1971 she spoke of herself as a “half sister.” In her essay Transvestites: Your Half Sisters and Half Brothers of the Revolution, she specifically claims her use of the word “transvestite” as only applying to the gay community: “Transvestites are homosexual men and women who dress in clothes of the opposite sex.” People now want to call me a lesbian because I’m with Julia, and I say, “No. I’m just me. I’m not a lesbian.” I’m tired of being labeled. I don’t even like the label transgender. I’m tired of living with labels. I just want to be who I am. I am Sylvia Rivera. Ray Rivera left home at the age of 10 to become Sylvia. And that’s who I am.”\n\n1953\n\nThe State Department fires 381 gay and lesbian employees. In the early 1950s, the entire country was in the grips of the Red Scare as Wisconsin Republican Sen. Joseph McCarthy was conducting his witch hunts. One of his main platforms was the Senate’s Subcommittee on the Investigation of Loyalty of State Department Employees. While McCarthy’s main targets were imaginary Communists in the State Department, gay employees were also seen as “subversives” in need of rooting out. Both homosexuals and Communist Party members were seen as subversive elements in American society who shared the same ideals of antitheism, rejection of the middle-class morality, and lack of conformity. In the eyes of the government, they were seen as scheming and manipulative and, most importantly, would put their own agendas above that of the general population. McCarthy also as-sociated homosexuality and communism as “threats to the ‘American way of life’.” Homosexuality was directly linked to security concerns, and more government employees were dismissed because of their homosexual sexual orientation than because they were left-leaning or communist. George Chauncey noted that, “The specter of the invisible homosexual, like that of the invisible communist, haunted Cold War America,” and homosexuality (and by implication homosexuals themselves) were constantly referred to not only as a disease, but also as an invasion, like the perceived danger of communism and subversives. Among the more high-profile targets was Samuel Reber III (July 15, 1903 – December 25, 1971) a twenty-seven year career diplomat who announced his retirement in May of 1953 after McCarthy charged that he was a security risk which was a barely-concealed code for homosexual. By then, President Dwight D. Eisenhower had already responded to McCarthy’s witch hunt by signing an executive order that mandated the firing of all federal employees who were deemed guilty of “sexual perversion,” whether proven or not. Eisenhower also announced a re-organization of the State Department. Rep. Charles B Brownson, an Indiana Republican with his own lesser-known witch hunt underway in the House Government Operations Committee, asked the State Department for a progress report in rooting out homosexuals. On July 2, 1953, the State Department’s chief security officer R.W. Scott McLeod revealed that 351 homosexuals and 150 other “security risks” had been fired between 1950 and 1953.\n\n1970\n\nThe Fifth Biennial Convention of the Lutheran Church in America expresses its opposition to discrimination and oppression of gay men and lesbians.\n\n1981\n\n“Rare Cancer Seen in Homosexuals” is the first story in The New York Times about the mysterious disease that will later be named AIDS.\n\n1984\n\nFigure skater Johnny Weir (July 2, 1984) is born. Johnny an American figure skater, fashion designer, and television commentator. He is a two-time Olympian, the 2008 World bronze medalist, a two-time Grand Prix Final bronze medalist, the 2001 World Junior Champion, and a three-time U.S. national champion (2004–2006). Weir is openly gay. In 2011, Weir married Victor Voronov (b. 1984), a Georgetown Law graduate of Russian Jewish descent, in a civil ceremony on New Year’s Eve in New York City. He is also known for his sports commentary with Tara Lipinski, as well as his work in LGBTQ activism.\n\n1989\n\nInternal Revenue Service employees who are members of the National Treasury Employee’s Union receive a new contract that includes protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\n2009, India\n\nSame-sex sex acts are decriminalized in India, citing that the existing laws violate fundamental rights to personal liberty. The Delhi High Court rules that the existing laws violate fundamental rights to personal liberty (Article 21 of the Indian Constitution) and equality (Article 14) and prohibition of discrimination (Article 15). Before the overturning of this 148-year-old law, so-called homosexual acts were punished with a ten-year prison sentence.\n\nJuly 3\n\n1783\n\nDeborah Sampson Gannett (December 17, 1760 – April 29, 1827) was a woman who disguised herself as a man in order to serve in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. She was one of a small number of women with a documented record of military combat experience in that war. She served 17 months in the army under the name Robert Shirtliff of Uxbridge, Massachusetts. During her first battle, on July 3, 1782, out-side Tarrytown, New York, she took two musket balls in her thigh and a cut on her forehead. She begged her fellow soldiers to let her die and not take her to a doctor, but a soldier put her on his horse and took her to a hospital. The doctors treated her head wound, but she left the hospital before they could attend to her leg. Fearful that her identity would be discovered, she removed one of the balls herself with a penknife and sewing needle, but the other one was too deep for her to reach. Her leg never fully healed. On April 1, 1783, she was reassigned to new duties, and spent seven months serving as a waiter to General John Paterson. On this day, Sampson was wounded in 1782, and was honorably discharged at West Point, New York in 1783. During the summer of 1783, Sampson became ill in Philadelphia and was cared for by Doctor Barnabas Binney (1751-1787). He removed her clothes to treat her and discovered the cloth she used to bind her breasts. Without revealing his discovery to army authorities, he took her to his house, where his wife, daughters, and a nurse took care of her. She was discharged at West Point, New York, on October 25, 1783, after a year and a half of service. In January 1792, Sampson petitioned the Massachusetts State Legislature for pay which the army had withheld from her because she was a woman. The legislature granted her petition and Governor John Hancock signed it. The legislature awarded her 34 pounds plus interest back to her discharge in 1783. An Official Record of Deborah Gannet’s service as ‘Robert Shirtliff” from May 20, 1782 to Oct 25, 1783 appears in the “Massachusetts Soldiers and Sailors of the Revolutionary War” series. During World War II the Liberty Ship S.S. Deborah Gannett (2620) was named in her honor. It was laid down March 10, 1944, launched April 10, 1944 and scrapped in 1962. As of 2001, the town flag of Plympton incorporates Sampson as the Official Heroine of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Meryl Streep named Deborah Sampson as one of the women who made history in her speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 26, 2016.\n\n1975\n\nIn a change of policy, the U.S. Civil Service Commission decides to consider applications by lesbians and gay men on a case-by-case basis. Previously, homosexuality was grounds for automatic disqualification.\n\n1981\n\nThe CDC initially refers to AIDS as GRID – Gay Related Immune Deficiency Disorder.\n\n1989\n\nAndy Lippincott, a fictional character in the cartoon strip Doonesbury, was hospitalized with AIDS. The character first appears in January 1976, in a law library. Joanie Caucus becomes attracted to him so Lippincott confesses he is gay. Joanie is heart-broken and takes some time to recover. Lippincott contributes position papers to Virginia Slade’s failed run for Congress in 1976. He disappears from the strip for a few years after this storyline. In 1982, the character reappears as an organizer for the Bay Area Gay Alliance and contributes to the congressional re-election of Lacey Davenport. In 1989 he returns to the strip again when he is diagnosed with AIDS. Over the course of the next year, Lippincott’s battles with the disease, and eventual death from it, helped bring the AIDS crisis into popular culture. Ultimately, he is shown dying to the sound of the Beach Boys’ song Wouldn’t It Be Nice. This storyline led to a Pulitzer Prize nomination for Garry Trudeau, but three newspapers of the 900 carrying the strip refused to publish it as being in bad taste. Andy Lippincott may be the only fictional character with a panel on the AIDS quilt and hangs in The NAMES Project Foundation‘s offices in Atlanta though it was not actually sewn into a block of The AIDS Memorial Quilt.\n\n1992, Buenos Aires\n\nAn estimated 300 lesbians and gay men march in Argentina’s first-ever Pride Celebration. While same-sex sexual activity between consenting adults in private had been legal since 1887, there were no civil rights laws de-signed to protect LGBT people, and public opinion tended to look down upon LGBT people. While not given official recognition until 1992, the Comunidad Homosexual Argentina publicly campaigned for the human rights of LGBT people. Since 1987 the rights of gay and bisexual women have been defended by Cuadernos de Existencia Lesbiana. Significant legal and social progress began to be seen in the 1990s.\n\n2000\n\nArthur “JR” Warren, Jr. (1974 – July 3, 2000) is murdered. Warren, 26, who was African American and gay, was beaten and then run over by a car. One of the two teens who killed him had been sexually involved with him and claimed he felt humiliated when rumors of their relationship began to spread. Warren lived with learning disabilities and a birth defect that caused him to be born with several fingers missing on one hand. He was widely regarded in his community as a “soft spoken” young man. At 16, he came out to his mother and the minister at his church and found acceptance and support with both. After his death, his mother Brenda Warren addressed a hate-crimes rally in Washington, D.C. and lobbied for the inclusion of sexual orientation in West Virginia’s hate crimes law. Arthur Warren’s funeral was held on July 8, 2000, at his family’s church, and was attended by hundreds of mourners. His parents insisted that the coffin be open for viewing. “We want people to see what they did to my son,” said Brenda Warren. The Warrens later told CNN during an interview that they hoped the suspects would be tried as adults and the murder treated as a hate crime.\n\n2003, Spain\n\nThe first gay hotel, the Axel, opens in Barcelona. The Axel company created a cosmopolitan and tolerant environment where atmosphere, diversity and respect are valued. The construction of Axel Hotel Barcelona, opened in 2003, was the beginning of a project that is now a chain. In 2007, Axel opened its first hotel in South America, the Axel Hotel Buenos Aires, and two years later, in 2009, Axel Hotel Berlin.\n\n2005, Spain\n\nSame-sex marriage is legalized. In 2004, the nation’s newly elected Socialist Party (PSOE) Government, led by Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, begins a campaign for its legalization, including the right of adoption by same-sex couples. The law took effect on this day, making Spain the third country in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry across the entire country, after the Netherlands and Belgium, and 17 days ahead of the right being extended across all of Canada. The U.S. was 17th.\n\nJuly 4\n\n1826\n\nComposer Stephen Foster (July 4, 1826 – January 13, 1864), born in Pittsburgh and known as “the father of American music,” was famous for his parlor and minstrel music. Foster wrote over 200 songs; among his best-known are Oh! Susanna, Camptown Races, Swanee River, My Old Kentucky Home, and more. He likely abandoned his wife for fellow composer George Cooper. There are many biographers who have published works on the life of Stephen Foster but details differ widely. Foster wrote very little biographical information himself. His brother destroyed much of the information about Stephen that he judged to reflect negatively upon the family.\n\n1855\n\nFirst edition of Walt Whitman’s (May 31, 1819 – March 26, 1892) Leaves of Grass is published. It’s considered the clearest expression of the author’s homosexual desires.\n\n1895\n\nThe song America the Beautiful is published. Its author, Katharine Lee Bates (August 12, 1859 – March 28, 1929) was a professor at Wellesley College who lived with Katharine Coman (November 23, 1857 – January 11, 1915), as ‘one soul together.’ Coman was a history and political economy teacher and founder of the Wellesley College School Economics department. The pair lived together for twenty-five years until Coman’s death in 1915.\n\n1965\n\nOrganized by ECHO, the East Coast Homophile Organizations, demonstrators picket at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. Picketers returned each year through 1969 for what came to be known as the Annual Reminder. It was the beginning a new era in Philadelphia LGBT culture as a presence in the community. A small group of conservatively dressed lesbians and gay men picket Independence Hall in in one of the first public demonstrations for gay rights. Among those marching is Barbara Gittings (July 31, 1932 – February 18, 2007). The picket is to call public attention to the lack of civil rights for LGBT people. The gatherings continue annually for five years. The Daughters of Bilitis and Mattachine Society members participate in the fifth and final picket in 1969.\n\n1970\n\nThe General Assembly of the Unitarian Universalist Association becomes the first mainstream religious group in the US to recognize publicly the existence of gay, lesbian, and bisexual clergy and laity among its members and to demand “an end to all discrimination against homosexuals.”\n\n1973\n\nThe Seattle Lesbian Separatist Group (later the Gorgons) issues The Amazon Analysis, a manifesto and handbook of lesbian separatism. The paper’s nearly 100 mimeographed pages are passed among lesbians across the country.\n\n1975, Canada\n\nIn Winnipeg, the New Democratic Party Gay Caucus is formed at the NDP national convention.\n\n1976\n\nDykes on Bikes is founded by Soni Wolf as a group of lesbians on motorcycles who come together to lead the San Francisco Pride Parade. In 1976 a small group of 20 – 25 women motorcyclists gathered at the head of the San Francisco Pride Parade and, unbeknownst to them, a tradition began. Soni coined the phrase “Dykes on Bikes.” The San Francisco Chronicle picked it up and ran with it. Chapters of the club have been leading Pride Parades around the world ever since.\n\n2020, Russia\n\nThe United States Embassy in Moscow defied U.S. President anti-gay Donald Trump by hanging a rainbow LGBT PRIDE flag on its building after Trump ordered embassies around the world not to do so. Russian President Vladimir Putin mocked the flag, suggesting it reflected on the orientation of the diplomats. Putin also signed amendments to the constitution backed by way of a national vote that includes a clause on marriage being between a man and a woman, aimed at preventing legalization of gay unions. Putin then claimed that Russia does not discriminate against people on the basis of sexual orientation. In 2013 Putin signed into law, amid a storm of international condemnation, the prevention of ‘foisting’ LGBT information to children. The law has since been used as a pretext to ban gay pride events and jail LGBT activists in Russia.\n\nJuly 5\n\n1842\n\nAndrew George Scott (July 5, 1842 – January 20, 1880), also known as Captain Moonlite, is born. He was an Irish-born Australian bushranger and folk figure. He gathered a band of thieves together and became especially close to one James Nesbit. Nesbit was to die in a shoot-out after which Scott was imprisoned. While there he wrote letters that declared his undying love for Nesbit in terms that were extravagant and uncompromising.\n\n1853, UK\n\nCecil Rhodes (July 5, 1853 – March 26, 190) is born in Hertfordshire, England. He was a British businessman, mining magnate and politician in South Africa who served as Prime Minister of the Cape Colony from 1890 to 1896. The owner of the Kimberley Diamond Mines, he was a multi-millionaire whose De Beers diamond company, formed in 1888, retains its prominence into the 21st century. Rhodes never married saying that he would not be a dutiful husband. Some writers and academics have suggested that Rhodes may have been homosexual and had relationships with Sir Leander Starr Jameson (9 February 1853 – 26 November 1917) and Henry Latham Curry (1863 – 1945). Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) was named for him. He also created the Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford. While Rhodes is considered a hero, the true story is that he was a blatant racist who built his empire on “land grabs” and murders of thousands in Zimbabwe.\n\n1889, France\n\nJean Cocteau (July 5, 1889 – October 11, 1963) is born in Maisons-Lafitte, France. A giant in the arts, Cocteau was a poet, a novelist, a playwright, and a filmmaker. He is best known for his novel Les Enfants Terribles (1929), and the films The Blood of a Poet (1930), Les Parents Terribles (1948), Beauty and the Beast (1946) and Orpheus (1949). His affairs with the handsome young men of Paris is as legendary as his art. Cocteau’s longest-lasting relationships were with the French actors Jean Marais (11 December 1913 – 8 November 1998) and Édouard Dermit, whom Cocteau formally adopted. Cocteau cast Marais in The Eternal Return (1943), Beauty and the Beast (1946), Ruy Blas (1947), and Orpheus (1949).\n\n1903, Netherlands\n\nHendrik “Hein” Vos (5 July 1903 – 23 April 1972) was a Dutch politician of the Labour Party (PvdA). Vos was the first known Dutch gay politician. This fact was an open secret in Dutch politics at that time. His life partner was the journalist and writer Aar van de Werfhorst (March 3, 1907-January 20, 1994).\n\n1970\n\nWayne Besen (born July 5, 1970) is an American gay rights advocate. He is a former investigative journalist for WABI-TV, a former spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, and the founder of Truth Wins Out. Besen came out to his parents before starting his Truth Wins Out organization. After coming out to his parents, they bought him an ex-gay DVD that could supposedly hypnotize people and turn them straight. It was that and the invitation by President George W. Bush of ex-gay leader Alan Chambers to the White House that led him to start Truth Wins Out. Besen has interviewed hundreds of former and current “ex-gays” and is an out-spoken critic of organizations such as Homosexuals Anonymous. Besen announced on his truthwinsout.org website that he married his boyfriend of five years Jamie Brundage on December 8, 2011 in the City Hall of Burlington, VT.\n\n1978, Canada\n\nIn Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, an hour-long Gay News and Views begins on a local station. It is the first regularly scheduled gay radio program in Canada.\n\n1978, Canada\n\nThe Quebec Human Rights Commission decides that Montreal Catholic School Commission’s refusal to rent facilities to a gay group is discriminatory. It is the first such finding by the Commission since the inclusion of “sexual orientation” in the provincial Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n1980, Canada\n\nThe national convention of the Liberal Party of Canada adopts a resolution to include sexual orientation in the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n\n1985\n\nMegan Rapinoe (July 5, 1985) is the first openly gay woman in the annual Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. Megan is an American professional soccer player who heads the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) as well as the United States national team. Winner of the Ballon d’Or Féminin and named the Best FIFA Women’s Player in 2019, Rapinoe won gold with the national team at the 2012 London Summer Olympics, 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup, and 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup. Rapinoe co-captained the national team alongside Carli Lloyd and Alex Morgan from 2018 to 2020. She previously played for the Chicago Red Stars, Philadelphia Independence, and MagicJack in Women’s Professional Soccer (WPS) as well as Olympique Lyon in France’s Division 1 Féminine.\n\n1987\n\nJames H. Donovan was a New York state senator. On this day, he suggests that giving teens rosary beads would prevent the spread of AIDS more effectively than the distribution of condoms.\n\n2011, Serbia\n\nThe Serbian parliament approves a law to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nJuly 6\n\n1750, France\n\nBruno Lenoir and Jean Diot, 18 and 20 years old, are caught having sex. They are strangled and burned in the Place de Greve by “seven wagons of brushwood, two hundred faggots (bundles of wood sticks), and straw.” This is the last execution in France for consensual sodomy. In October, 2014, a memorial plaque was unveiled the Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo to remember them.\n\n1907, Mexico\n\nMexican painter Frida Kahlo (July 6, 1907 – July 13, 1954) is born. Inspired by Mexican popular culture, she employed a naïve folk-art style to explore questions of identity, post-colonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society. Kahlo was bisexual and a polio survivor. She married Diego Rivera twice, had an affair with Leon Trotsky, and had affairs with several women as well. La Casa Azul, her home in Coyoacán, was opened as a museum in 1958, and has become one of the most popular museums in Mexico City. In the United States, she became the first Hispanic woman to be honored with a U.S. postage stamp, in 2001, and in 2012 was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display in Chicago that celebrates the LGBT history and people.\n\n1943\n\nLeonard P. Matlovich (July 6, 1943 – June 22, 1988) is born. During three tours of duty in Viet Nam, he would earn, among other honors, a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart, and an Air Force Commendation Medal. Sgt. Matlovich was discharged when he came out as gay. He died of AIDS in June 1988, at the age of 45. Matlovich was the first gay service member to purposely out himself to the military to fight their ban on gays, and perhaps the best-known gay man in America in the 1970s next to Harvey Milk (May 22, 1930 – November 27, 1978). His fight to stay in the United States Air Force after coming out of the closet became a cause célèbre around which the gay community rallied. His case resulted in articles in newspapers and magazines throughout the country, numerous television interviews, and a television movie on NBC. Matlovich was the first named openly gay person to appear on the cover of a U.S. newsmagazine – of the September 8, 1975 issue of Time magazine, making him a symbol for thousands of gay and lesbian service members and gay people generally. According to author Randy Shilts (August 8, 1951 – February 17, 1994), “It marked the first time the young gay movement had made the cover of a major newsweekly. To a movement still struggling for legitimacy, the event was a major turning point.” His tombstone, meant to be a memorial to all gay veterans, does not bear his name. It reads, “When I was in the military, they gave me a medal for killing two men and a dis-charge for loving one.”\n\n1966\n\nGlenn Christopher Scarpelli (born July 6, 1966) is an American former child actor and singer. He is best known for his role as Alex Handris from 1980 to 1983 on the sitcom One Day at a Time. Scarpelli came out as gay in adulthood. He resides in Arizona where he and his then-partner Jude Belanger established the Sedona Now Network, a community television station, in 2003. Scarpelli and Belanger were married in California in 2008 but filed for divorce in 2012.\n\n1979\n\nBilly S. Jones, Darlene Garner, and Delores P. Berry co-found the National Coalition of Black Lesbians and Gays in Washington, D.C. Bisexual and transgender people are included in bylaws, mission and outreach. The National Coalition of Black Lesbians and Gays (formerly The National Coalition of Black Gays) was the United States’ first national organization for African American and Third World gay rights. While many Washington, D.C.-based gay rights organizations opposed the 1979 National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, NCBG’s support for the march smoothed the way for the event. The organization was to provide a national advocacy forum for African American gay men and lesbians at a time when no other organization existed to express their views. The organizers, also including Louis Hughes, Gil Gerald, Rev. Renee McCoy, and John Gee, were motivated by a belief that existing gay and lesbian organizations did not represent the views and experiences of African Americans. In 1984, NCBG added Lesbian to its name to become the National Coalition of Black Lesbians and Gays. The organization’s headquarters moved to Detroit, Michigan briefly in the mid-1980s. By 1986, several key leaders left the or-ganization, and eventually the group (without any official announcement) faded out of existence. By 1990, formal operations ended for the organiza-tion. As founding member A. Billy S. Jones described, “We just faded away. Some board members re-fused to acknowledge that it was time to say goodbye but folks just burned out and faded away.”\n\n1992\n\nSome 50 activists in New York City attend the first public meeting of the Lesbian Avengers, a direct action group focused on issues vital to lesbian survival and visibility.” Dozens of other chapters quickly emerged world-wide, a few expanding their mission to include questions of gender, race, and class. The Lesbian Avengers was founded by Ana Maria Simo, Sarah Schulman ((born July 28, 1958), Maxine Wolfe, Anne-Christine D’Adesky, Marie Honan, and Anne Maguire, six longtime lesbian activists who were involved in a variety of LGBT groups from the Medusa’s Revenge lesbian theater to ACT-UP and ILGO (the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization). Lesbian Avenger Ann Northrop underlined the point. “We’re not going to be invisible anymore … We are going to be prominent and have power and be part of all decision making.” Her assumptions were largely proved in interviews with Avengers in the 1993 documentary film Lesbian Avengers Eat Fire, Too edited by Sue Friedrich and Janet Baus. Some members, though, joked they also joined to meet women.\n\n2007, Hungary\n\nGábor Szetey (born January 6, 1968) is a Hungarian former politician and former Secretary of State for Human Resources in the Gyurcsány government, a role he held from July 2006 to April 2009. He was the first openly gay Hungarian government member. On this day, he publicly declares that he’s gay at the opening night of the Budapest LGBT film festival, making him the first out LGBT person in Hungarian government. He currently lives in Spain.\n\nJuly 7\n\n1974, Canada\n\nThe Quebec Charter of Human Rights is adopted by the National Assembly without legal protection for gays.\n\n2010, Sweden\n\nTobias Billstrom (born 27 December 1973) is the first openly bisexual person elected to the Swedish government.

He served as Minister for Migration and Asylum Policy in the Swedish Government from 2006 to 2014 and has been a Member of the Swedish Riksdag for Malmö Municipality since 2002. Although several controversial statements regarding immigration and immigrants, Billström is the longest serving Minister for Migration and Asylum Policy in Sweden. From 2014 to 2017, he served as First Deputy Speaker of the Riksdag.\n\n2014\n\nThe first White House LGBT Innovation Summit takes place to discuss ways in which technology can help the LGBT community’s challenges. Speakers included Tim Gill (born October 18, 1953), founder of Quark publishing software; transgender activist and model Geena Rocero (born 1983 or 1984), founder of transgender rights group Gender Proud; and Leanne Pittsford (born 1980), founder of Lesbians Who Tech, an organization dedicated to increasing the number of women and lesbians in technology. This was the first summit of its kind held at the White House. Nearly 180 people attend.\n\nJuly 8\n\n1864\n\nFred Holland Day (July 8, 1864 – November 12, 1933) is born. He was an American photographer and publisher, and the first to advocate that photography should be considered a fine art. Day’s life and works had long been controversial since his photographic subjects were often nude young men. Since the 1990s, Day’s works have been included in major exhibitions by museum curators, notably in the solo Day retrospective at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 2000/2001 and similar shows at the Royal Photographic Society in England and the Fuller Museum of Art. Art historians are once again taking an interest in Day, and there are now significant academic texts on Day’s homoerotic portraiture, and its similarities to the work of Walter Pater and Thomas Eakins.\n\n1906\n\nPhilip Cortelyou Johnson (July 8, 1906 – January 25, 2005) was an American architect best known for his works of modern and postmodern architecture. Among his best known designs are his modernist Glass House in New Canaan, Connecticut, the postmodern 550 Madison Avenue in New York, designed for AT&T, and 190 South La Salle Street in Chicago. In 1978, he was awarded an American Institute of Architects Gold Medal and in 1979 the first Pritzker Architecture Prize. Johnson was gay. He came out publicly in 1993 and was regarded as “the best-known openly gay architect in America”.\n\n1950\n\nHarry Hay (April 7, 1912 – October 24, 2002) and Rudi Gernreich (August 8, 1922 – April 21, 1985) meet on this day and later found the Mattachine Society, one of the earliest homophile organizations in the U.S. Hay was a prominent American gay rights activist, communist, labor advocate, and Native American civil rights campaigner. He was a founder of the Mattachine Society, the first sustained gay rights group in the United States, as well as the Radical Faeries, a loosely affiliated gay spiritual movement. Gernreich was an Austrian-born American fashion designer whose avant-garde clothing designs are generally regarded as the most innovative and dynamic fashion of the 1960s. He purposefully used fashion design as a social statement to advance sexual freedom, producing clothes that followed the natural form of the female body, freeing them from the constraints of high fashion.\n\n1978\n\nA group of men set out to attack homosexuals in Central Park, injuring several with baseball bats, including former Olympic and world champion ice skater Dick Button (born July 18, 1929).\n\n1980\n\nThe Democratic Rules Committee states that it will not discriminate against homosexuals.

Hunter’s autobiography, Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star (2005), co-written with Eddie Muller, became a New York Times best-seller as did the paperback edition in 2007. Hunter had long-term relationships with actor Anthony Perkins (April 4, 1932 – September 12, 1992) and champion figure skater Ronnie Robertson (September 25, 1937 – February 4, 2000) before settling down with his partner of over 35 years, film producer Allan Glaser.\n\nJuly 9\n\n1550, Italy\n\nJacopo Bonfadio (c. 1508 – July 1550) is tried and beheaded for sodomy, most likely because he published gossipy accounts of wealthy Genoese families. He was an Italian humanist and historian. Several humanists were tried for sodomy during this time as well, but Bonfadio is one of few to be executed.\n\n1775, UK\n\nMatthew Gregory Lewis (9 July 1775 – 16 May 1818) is born. He was an English novelist and dramatist, often referred to as “Monk” Lewis because of the success of his 1796 Gothic novel The Monk. Silly, stilted, and great fun to read, the genre was the high camp of its day. His most famous work was Ambrosio, The Monk written in 1795. Like most Gothic novels, it takes place in a Latin country. In this case in a monastery where Ambrosio, the head of the order, meets Matilda. She sneaks into his bed disguised as a man and quickly reveals she is a woman. After humping him into a frenzy he turns into a satyr and can’t get enough. In real life, Lewis was in love with a 14-year-old boy who brought him nothing but misery.\n\n1893\n\nDorothy Thompson (July 9, 1893 – January 30, 1961) is born in Lancaster, New York. Thompson, a newspaper writer and radio commentator, was expelled from Germany by Hitler because of her critical reports on Nazism.

Other lovers include Gertrude Franchot Tone (1876 – 1953), the feminist politician and mother of actor Franchot Tone. In 1939 she was recognized by Time magazine as the second most influential woman in America next to Eleanor Roosevelt (October 11, 1884 – November 7, 1962), and was featured on the cover. She was married three times, most famously to second husband and Nobel Prize in literature winner Sinclair Lewis. She is regarded by some as the “First Lady of American Journalism.”\n\n1926, Italy\n\nMathilde Krim (July 9, 1926 – January 15, 2018) is born.

She later added Kantrowitz to her name to honor her Jewish roots. Kaye/Kantrowitz was active in the Harlem Civil Rights Movement as a teenager. When she was 17, she worked with the Harlem Education Project.

The great French writer, perhaps the greatest of the first half of the 20th century, was rejected when he brought the manuscript for Remembrance of Things Past to a publisher. The rejection note reads “one has no idea what it’s all about.” His friend Andre Gide pointed out that Proust suffered a pronoun problem. Too many of his characters were women when they were intended to be men. Proust was homosexual, and his sexuality and relationships with men are often discussed by his biographers. His romantic relationship with composer Reynaldo Hahn (August 9, 1874 – January 28, 1947) and his infatuation with his chauffeur and secretary, Alfred Agostinelli, are well documented.\n\n1909\n\nThe book Road to Oz, the fifth in the Oz series by L. Frank Baum (May 15, 1856 – May 6, 1919) is published. In gay slang, a “friend of Dorothy” is a term for a gay man. While the precise origin of the term is unknown, some believe it is derived from this book. The book introduces readers to Polychrome who, upon meeting Dorothy’s traveling companions, ex-claims, “You have some queer friends, Dorothy,” and she replies, “The queerness doesn’t matter, so long as they’re friends.” More commonly, “friend of Dorothy” refers to the film The Wizard of Oz because Judy Garland, who starred as the main character Dorothy, is a gay icon. In the early 1980s, the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) was investigating homosexuality in Chicago. Having heard gay men refer to themselves as “friends of Dorothy,” the NIS went on a futile search for the elusive woman clearly at the center of a homosexual ring.\n\n1931\n\nJerry Herman (born July 10, 1931– December 26, 2019) was an American composer and lyricist, known for his work in Broadway musical theater.

The organization, founded in 1955 by Del Martin (May 5, 1921 – August 27, 2008) and Phyllis Lyon (born November 10, 1924) in San Francisco, was conceived as a social alternative to lesbian bars which were subject to raids and police harassment. As the DOB gained members, their focus shifted to providing support to women who were afraid to come out. The DOB educated them about their rights and about gay history. The historian Lillian Faderman (born July 18, 1940) declared, “It’s very establishment in the midst of witch-hunts and police harassment was an act of courage, since members always had to fear that they were under attack, not be-cause of what they did, but merely because of who they were.” The Daughters of Bilitis endured for 14 years, becoming an educational resource for lesbians, gay men, researchers and mental health professionals. Bilitis is the name given to a fictional lesbian contemporary of Sappho by the French poet Pierre Louÿsin his 1894 work The Songs of Bilitis in which Bilitis lives on the Isle of Lesbos alongside Sappho.\n\n1972\n\nJim Foster and Madeleine Davis are the first openly gay and lesbian people to address a major party presidential nominating convention, the Democratic National Convention, held in Miami Beach, Florida.

The Vito Russo Award is named in his memory and is presented to an openly gay or lesbian member of the media community for their outstanding contribution in combating homophobia. When he published the first edition of The Celluloid Closet in 1981, there was little question that it was a ground-breaking book. Today it is still one of the most informative and provocative books written about gay people and popular culture. Russo appeared in the 1989 Academy Award-winning documentary Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt as a “storyteller,” relating the life and death of his lover Jeffrey Sevcik (1955-1986).

Believing that the purpose of poetry was distance from the world—he was a strong advocate of art for art’s sake—George’s writing had many ties with the French Symbolist movement and he was in contact with many of its representatives including Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Verlaine. George was an important bridge between the 19th century and German modernism even though he was a harsh critic of the then modern era.

Scott Tucker has called him “not only a left-wing critic of sexual and political conformism among sectors of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender movements, but … also one of the notable public intellectuals of the civil libertarian left. On this day Ireland suggested rebuilding the Gay Movement in The Nation, and that “the direction the gay movement takes will depend not on checkbook activism but on the kind of energy and commitment that people bring to work in their own communities. This may involve some nasty battles with more conservative gay elements and force the debate into the open, but the ultimate goal is victories that last, and that’s worth the fight.”\n\n2018\n\nAngela Bowen (February 6, 1936 – July 12, 2018) dies.

They were a young interracial couple living in Fort Smith, Arkansas from May to July of 1888. Both men were charged with sodomy. This is thought to be the first case where two men were duly married to one another.\n\n1934, Germany\n\nHitler gave a speech in response to a retaliation that occurred after the murder of Ernst Rohm. The speech equated being homosexual with being a traitor.\n\n1935, France\n\nMonique Wittig (July 13, 1935 – January 3, 2003) is born in Haut-Rhin, France. She was a French author and feminist theorist and one of the founders of the Mouvement de Libration des Femmes (MLF) (Women’s Liberation Movement). On August 26, 1970, accompanied by numerous other women, she put flowers under the Arc de Triomphe to honor the wife of The Unknown Soldier. This symbolic action was considered to be the founding event of French feminism. Defining herself as a radical lesbian, she and other lesbians during the early 1980s in France and Quebec reached a consensus that “radical lesbianism” posits heterosexuality as a political regime that must be overthrown.\n\n1943\n\nDaniel Joseph “Danny” Lockin (July 13, 1943 – August 21, 1977) was an American actor and dancer who appeared on stage, television, and film. He was best known for his portrayal of the character Barnaby Tucker in the 1969 film Hello, Dolly! On the night of August 21, 1977, Lockin went to a gay bar in Garden Grove, California and left with Charles Leslie Hopkins who already had a police record and was on probation at the time. Several hours later, Hopkins called police to say that a man had entered his apartment and tried to rob him. Upon arrival, police found Lockin’s body on the floor of Hopkin’s apartment. He had been stabbed 100 times and bled to death. His body had also been mutilated after death. Hopkins claimed he had no idea how the dead body got in his apartment. He was arrested, convicted of voluntary manslaughter, and sentenced to a four-year prison term.\n\n1944\n\nJoan E. Biren or JEB (born July 13, 1944) is an American feminist photographer and filmmaker who dramatizes the lives of LGBT’s in contexts that range from healthcare and hurricane relief to Womyn’s Music and anti-racism. For portraits, she encourages sitters to act as her “muse” rather than her “subject.” In her early 20s, Biren and others, including Rita Mae Brown (born November 28, 1944) and Charlotte Bunch (October 13, 1944), formed The Furies Collective, a radical experiment in lesbian feminist separatist organizing. Though the collective lasted only about 18 months, it had a pro-found influence on lesbian thought through its newspaper, The Furies, and other publications. JEB’s papers and visual materials are permanently archived at The Sophia Smith Collection, the premiere women’s history collection, at Smith College. Many of her photographs are located at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. In addition, The George Washington University houses a collection of photographs used in Queerly Visible: 1971–1991.\n\n1953\n\nDanitra Vance (July 13, 1954 – August 21, 1994) is born. She was an African American comedian and actress best known as a cast member on the NBC sketch show Saturday Night Live during its eleventh season and for work in feature films like Sticky Fingers (1988), Limit Up (1990) and Jumpin’ at the Boneyard (1992). Vance was the first African American woman to become an SNL repertory player in 1985. She was awarded an NAACP Image Award in 1986 and later won an Obie Award for her performance in the theatrical adaptation of Spunk, a collection of short stories written by Zora Neale Hurston. She died of breast cancer in 1994.\n\n1970\n\nIn response to a letter asking if she considered homosexuality a disease, advice columnist Dear Abby responded “No! It is the inability to love at all which I consider an emotional illness.”\n\n1981, Canada\n\nToronto City Council appoints former journalist-turned-lawyer Arnold Bruner to conduct a study into relations between the police and the gay community. The appointment is made five months after the infamous Toronto bath-house raids.\n\n1982, France\n\nThe Ministry of Health removes homosexuality from its official list of mental illnesses.\n\n1982\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives votes to begin an investigation into reports that a major homosexual prostitution ring was operating in Congress. After a year of hearings no evidence was presented to support the allegations. The reports were the result of accusations from a former page who flunked a lie detector test.\n\n1984\n\nHate-monger Jerry Falwell appeared on television and denied that he had ever referred to the Metropolitan Community Church (MCC) as vile and satanic and its members “brute beasts” on his Old Time Gospel Hour. He offered $5,000 to anyone who could prove that he had. Rev. Jerry Sloan of MCC called Falwell’s toll-free number and purchased a copy of the tape as proof then demanded payment of the $5,000. When Falwell refused, Sloan sued and won.\n\n1984\n\nThe Brothers debuts on Showtime as the first television show in the United States with a gay lead character. Two conservative men support their younger brother when he comes out as gay and help him navigate being openly homosexual in 1980s Philadelphia.\n\n1998\n\nA full-page ad claiming gay men and lesbians can overcome their sexuality by becoming Christian ran in the New York Times. The ads were opposed by many in the scientific and medical communities including Dr. Dean Hamer (born 1951) of the National Institutes of Health who said the ads “fly in the face of scientific fact and are at odds with what we know from biological and psychological sciences.” Hamer is an American geneticist, author, and filmmaker. He is known for his research on the role of genetics in sexual orientation and human behavior, contributions to biotechnology and HIV/AIDS prevention, and popular books and documentaries on a wide range of topics.\n\n1999\n\nDr. Dean Edell wrote that “An investigation into the size of male sex organs reveals that homosexuals are generally better endowed than heterosexuals. This is a study done by the Kinsey Institute and researchers say there may be some relationship between innate sexual orientation tendencies and the size of genitalia. Researchers say they surveyed data gathered on 5,172 men and found penis sizes to be larger in homosexuals than heterosexuals based on five measurement standards. One reason for the differences in penile dimensions could be variations in prenatal hormone levels, according to the study published in the journal, Archives of Sexual Behavior.”\n\n1999\n\nThe Vatican orders Rev. Robert Nugent and Sister Jeannine Gramick to end their Maryland-based 22-year ministry to gays and lesbians. Jeannine Gramick, S. L., (born 1942) is a Catholic religious and advocate for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights as a co-founder of New Ways Ministry. Robert Nugent, a Catholic priest, became nationally known for his pastoral work with gay men and lesbians, a ministry that was officially ended in 1999 when the Vatican declared it “erroneous and dangerous.”\n\n2000\n\nLove in Action’s ex-gay poster boy Wade Richards revealed that his sexual orientation had not in fact changed. “I am and always have been a homosexual, and I do not believe that ex-gay ministries can ever change an individual’s sexual orientation.”\n\n2003\n\nGay activists took over the general assembly of the Church of England demanding equality for gays in the church.\n\n2016\n\nArmy Reserve officer Tammy Smith becomes the first openly gay U.S. general in American history. Tammy Smith (born c. 1963) is a Major General of the U.S. Army Reserve. She received her confirmation to Major General on July 13th, 2016 and was formally promoted to the position in a ceremony at the U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan in Seoul, Korea. Major General Smith is the Deputy Commanding General-Sustainment for Eighth Army. She also became the first female general officer to serve in an Eighth Army headquarters-level position. Prior to this position, she served as the Commanding General of the 98th Training Division (Initial Entry Training) and served for a year in the Afghanistan War. Smith married Tracey Hepner on March 31, 2012, in a ceremony at the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C. The ceremony was officiated by a military chaplain. The District of Columbia began recognizing same-sex marriages in 2010 but because Smith was in the Army she could not enter into a marriage until after Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell was re-pealed. She is the first openly gay U.S. flag officer to come out while serving since the repeal of the policy. Smith and her spouse Tracey Hepner are active in volunteer military family support event. General Smith retired in 2021.\n\nJuly 14\n\n1454, Italy\n\nAngelo Poliziano (July 14, 1454 – September 24, 1494) is born in Montepulciano, Tuscany. He wrote under the name Politian and was considered the successor to Ovid. He was a tutor to the children of Lorenzo de Medici. Young men flocked from throughout Europe to study under him. He died at 42 of a heart attack while in bed with one of his students.\n\n1897\n\nAnnie Hindle (1840s – July 14, 1897) died. She was the first popular male impersonator performer in the United States. Born in the 1840s in England, she and her adoptive mother migrated to New York City in 1868 where she performed as a male impersonator in solo acts and in minstrel shows from 1868 to 1886. She received high reviews and steady bookings. Her skills in male impersonation astounded her audience. A review of one of her performances at the Adelphi Theater in Galveston, Texas, noted, “Annie Hindle has proved a great success. As a male impersonator her sex is so concealed that one is apt to imagine that it is a man who is singing.” Hindle’s male impersonation career ended in 1886 when she married her dresser, Annie Ryan, while on a tour through the mid-west. Hindle dressed in male clothing and gave her name as Charles and a local Baptist minister performed the ceremony.\n\n1895\n\nKarl Heinrich Ulrichs (August 28, 1825 – July 14, 1895) dies. Ulrichs was an openly gay lawyer who was among the earliest to call for the repeal of Germany’s sodomy law Paragraph 175. He was truly a pioneer of the modern gay rights movement.\n\n1926\n\nCharles Pierce (July 14, 1926 – May 31, 1999) was one of the 20th century’s foremost female impersonators, particularly noted for his impersonation of Bette Davis. He was born on this day in Watertown, New York. Throughout his career, Pierce appeared in numerous television shows (Fame, Laverne and Shirley, Designing Women, Starsky & Hutch, and Love, American Style) as well as feature films. He died of cancer on May 31, 1999.\n\n1960\n\nJane Lynch (born July 14, 1960) is an American actress, singer, and comedian. She is best known for her role as Sue Sylvester in the musical television series Glee. Lynch is openly lesbian; in 2005, she was named one of Power Up’s “10 Amazing Gay Women in Showbiz.” Lynch married clinical psychologist Lara Embry on May 31, 2010, in Sunderland, Massachusetts. In June 2013, Lynch announced that she and Embry were divorcing after three years of marriage. The divorce was finalized in January 2014.\n\n1983\n\nRep. Gerry Studds (D-MA) (May 12, 1937 – October 14, 2006) comes out. He was the first openly gay member of Congress. Studds and partner Dean T. Hara (his companion since 1991) were married in Boston on May 24, 2004, one week after Massachusetts became the first state in the country to legalize same-sex marriage. Studds died on October 14, 2006, in Boston, at age 69, several days after suffering a pulmonary embolism.\n\n1983\n\nGraham Samuel Ackerman (born July 14, 1983) is an American gymnast. In April 2005 he won the national championship in the floor exercise event at the NCAA Men’s Gymnastics championship at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, making him a three-time national champ. In 2004 he won the national titles in two events—floor and vault. Ackerman is openly gay.\n\n1986\n\nIn an interview with People magazine, Roy Cohn (February 20, 1927 – August 2, 1986) denies that he was gay (he was) or that he had AIDS (he did). When Cohn brought on G. David Schine (September 11, 1927-June 19, 1996) as chief consultant to the McCarthy staff, speculation arose that Schine and Cohn had a sexual relationship. Cohn died of AIDS in 1986. During Senator Joseph McCarthy‘s investigations into Communist activity in the United States during the Second Red Scare, Cohn served as McCarthy’s chief counsel and gained special prominence during the Army-McCarthy hearings. He was also known for being a Justice prosecutor at the espionage trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and later for representing Donald Trump during his early business career. In 1984, Cohn was diagnosed with AIDS and attempted to keep his condition secret while receiving experimental drug treatment. He participated in clinical trials of AZT, a drug initially synthesized to treat cancer but later developed as the first anti-HIV agent for AIDS patients. He insisted to his dying day that his disease was liver cancer. He died on August 2, 1986, in Bethesda, Maryland, of complications from AIDS, at the age of 59. Cohn’s “absolute goal was to die completely broke and owing millions to the IRS. He succeeded.” He was buried in Union Field Cemetery in Queens, New York.\n\n1987\n\nIn Williamson, West Virginia, a public swimming pool was closed temporarily by Mayor Sam Kapourales who ordered a scrub-down of the diving board, lounge chairs, and locker room, the pool drained and refilled, and 16 times the normal amount of chlorine added because he learned that a man with AIDS had gone swimming in the pool.\n\n1998\n\nThe city council of West Hartford, Connecticut voted not to allow same sex couples access to family rate discounts at the city pool.\n\n2004, Canada\n\nYukon Territory becomes the most northern area of the world to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\n2011\n\nThe Fair, Accurate, Inclusive, and Respectful Education Act, also known as the FAIR Education Act is signed into law in California. The act requires that political, economic, and social contributions of LGBTQ people are included in educational curricula in California public schools. It also prohibits discrimination regarding school activities and groups.

He has little captaincy experience beyond a few games for Yorkshire but that is the nature of modern cricket with the international schedule crowding the calendar. But he has played 53 Tests and has been England’s leading player for the last two years and was appointed Cook's deputy in 2015.\"\n\nThe appointment comes as no surprise. Root was \"the standout candidate among the emerging generation of players,\" says Ali Martin of The Guardian, and he \"will now look to drive the team forward\". He will take charge of his first Test at Lord's in July, against South Africa.\n\n\"There will naturally be concerns as to how the additional responsibilities that come with the captaincy will affect Root's returns, not least since he remains a key player for England in all three formats and became a father in January,\" adds Martin.\n\nBut he notes the Yorkshire batsman \"has risen to most challenges since making his Test debut in Nagpur in late 2012\" and is ranked the third best batsman in the world.\n\n\"England will hope the additional responsibility brings a greater ruthlessness to his game – just three of his last 17 scores in excess of 50 having been converted into hundreds – and that his time back in the ranks of the one-day and Twenty20 sides, under captain Eoin Morgan, will prevent the role from being all-consuming.\"\n\nCook, who was in charge for four and a half years, stood down last week following the 4-0 series defeat in India. His side lost eight of 17 Tests in 2016.\n\nAlastair Cook felt 'let down' by ECB over Kevin Pietersen\n\n8 February\n\nAlastair Cook has said he felt \"let down\" by the England Cricket Board over the way they dealt with the sacking of Kevin Pietersen in 2014.\n\nA day after he announced he was stepping down as captain of the Test side, the 32-year-old Cook gave an interview to Sky Sports in which he discussed the controversy surrounding Pietersen, who was dismissed from the England squad exactly three years ago.\n\nDespite having amassed 13,7979 runs in 104 Tests, the South African-born batsman was informed his services were no longer required following allegations of breaches of team discipline.\n\nThe decision, \"unanimous\" among the England management, unleashed a storm of protest among cricket supporters, with celebrity fan Piers Morgan describing Cook as \"a repulsive little weasel\".\n\nOne of Cook's predecessors, Michael Vaughan, also expressed his dismay at the way Pietersen had been treated, tweeting: \"Would love to know what he does that is unmanageable. Think the ECB have to explain to everyone exactly what Pietersen has done so we can all have clarity and reasoning.\"\n\nIn conversation with Nasser Hussain at Lord's on Tuesday, Cook said of the furore: \"It was obviously a big part of my captaincy. I felt like it wasn't handled particularly well from the ECB. I was the lightning rod for it. Every person thought it was my decision and I felt I bore the brunt of that, unfairly in my personal opinion.\"\n\nCook admitted he was \"part of the decision making\" on whether to axe Pietersen but said there were as many as seven other people involved. \"I didn't have the final trigger. I felt I was the only person who made the decision. I felt a little bit let down by the ECB in that one period where they left me out to dry a little bit.\"\n\nWhen asked by Sky Sports if his reign as captaincy would be remembered as much for the Pietersen controversy as for his two Ashes series wins, Cook said: \"I don't think it will... but that's all gone now. It's part and parcel of the challenges of being captain. I can't say now I have any regrets. I've tried - whether I've got it right or wrong - to do what's best for English cricket at that time.\"\n\n'Drained' Alastair Cook steps down as England Test captain\n\n7 February\n\nAlastair Cook resigned as England Test captain on Monday after the job had left him \"drained\".\n\nAnnouncing his decision, the 32-year-old said: \"Stepping down has been an incredibly hard decision but I know this is the correct decision for me and at the right time for the team.\"\n\nAdding that playing for England is \"a privilege\", Cook said: \"I hope to carry on as a Test player, making a full contribution and helping the next England captain and the team however I can.\"\n\nEngland's director of cricket Andrew Strauss, who did the job himself for 50 Test matches, said Cook \"was getting drained by the relentlessness of being England captain\".\n\nThe Essex batsman succeeded Strauss in August 2012 and led his country in a record 59 Test matches. There were some highs – notably the Ashes victories in 2013 and 2015 – but also some lows, including last year's 4-0 series defeat in India.\n\nCook is England's highest run-scorer in Test cricket, accumulating 11,057 runs in 140 matches, and his reliability at the top of the order will be key to whoever takes over as captain.\n\nAs to who that might be, Strauss told Sky Sports one of the contenders for the job, Yorkshire batsman Joe Root, wouldn't be ruled out because of his lack of captaincy experience at county level.\n\n\"The reality in this day and age [is] it is very hard for England players to get a great deal of county captaincy experience,\" said Strauss. \"There is only so much you can do to prepare for the job, and playing in the England set-up for a number of years, understanding the demands of international cricket, that is really important.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old Root has led a team on only 19 occasions, but his intelligence, demeanour and talent single him out as a strong candidate to succeed Cook.\n\nHowever, Strauss stressed the ECB won't be rushed into making a decision, given that England don't play their first Test of the summer until July when they face South Africa over four matches.\n\n\"There is a process to go through,\" said Strauss. \"Now is a chance for myself and the selectors and the coach to have conversations and get an understanding of who the right person is, what their philosophy is and how they intend to take the England team forward, so that when we come to announce the new captain, we are clear he is the right man.\"\n\nAsked when a successor might be announced, he said: \"We hope to be in a position to name the new Test captain before the team head off to the one-day tour to the West Indies on the 22 February.\n\n\"That gives the new captain time to get used to the idea. It is quite a nice gap and I think he will benefit from that time.\"\n\nStrauss then expressed his gratitude to Cook for all he has done for English cricket in the last four and a half years.\n\n\"You only have to speak to the people under him to realise what an impact he has had on them,\" he said.\n\n\"It has taken a huge amount of character and resolve to get through some quite turbulent times. He has that empathy with what people have been through. He really cares about English cricket and his teammates, the support staff, and that is why he will be remembered so fondly by those he played with.\"", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Theara Coleman", "The Week Us", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "Devika Rao", "The Week Uk", "Rebekah Evans", "Mike Starling", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2017/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/01/england-cricket-new-zealand-stokes-mccullum-reign", "title": "Lord's ready for right royal occasion as Ben Stokes begins England ...", "text": "There promises to be a great deal of pomp and pageantry at Lord’s this week, if the preparations are anything to go by. With the Queen’s Jubilee apparently upon us, the union flags have been draped around the ground and the sound checks a day before the toss – deafening renditions of the national anthem over the public address system – point to an incoming avalanche of red, white and blue.\n\nBut for those well-heeled enough to afford a ticket or subscribe to Sky Sports all this will be secondary when players take the field at 11am. England versus New Zealand, the reigning world champions, over five days at the Home of Cricket? Few adornments should be required to make this a special fixture, even if MCC were busy decorating the place while trying to ride out the grumbles about pricing.\n\nAnd, of course, this is the first step in a new journey for this England team after 12 months of pain, with Ben Stokes starting out his captaincy and Brendon McCullum having crossed the divide as head coach. The pair barely knew each other before Rob Key, the new managing director, threw them together but they appear cut from similar cloth. Certainly the messages they are preaching mark a return to the simple, earthy cricketing truism of taking it a Test at a time that seemed to get lost during the previous regime.\n\nThat it is the Black Caps first up for the Stokes-McCullum axis adds a further layer of poetic narrative, for those looking on at least. Stokes may have spent the first 12 years of his life on the South Island, his late father, Ged, played rugby league for the Kiwis, while his mother, Deborah, and brother, James, have made the 12,000-mile trip from Christchurch to watch in person, but any extra sentiment will be kept in check.\n\nView image in fullscreen Matthew Potts will make his Test debut after an impressive start to the season with Durham. Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/Reuters\n\n“I’m very proud of where I came from, and my heritage and family and all that kind of stuff,” said Stokes, looking relaxed at the first of what may be a good few pre-match press conferences to come. “But, you know, I’ve had the England shirt on over 200 times. So, at the end of the day, it’s England versus New Zealand and I’m English. In terms of any extra emotions, it would be the same if I was doing it against Australia.”\n\nIt was Australia, of course, who set in motion the changes which have led to Stokes at the tiller, the 4-0 Ashes hammering over the winter – followed by a dismal 1-0 defeat in the Caribbean – bringing an end to Joe Root’s five-years in charge. Stokes, who demonstrated an early divergence from his predecessor by bluntly calling out the ticket prices, said he is not a fan of the term “red-ball reset”, however, preferring to label this week a “blank canvas” for his players, be they old or new.\n\nSign up for The Spin.\n\nHe and McCullum have opted for a similar palette as before and opted to name their final XI a day out. People often wonder why a team would show their hand to opponents before the toss but in this instance, with the bulk of the side well flagged – including returns for Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, plus Ollie Pope’s rise to No 3 – it was simply a case of letting the one newcomer, Matthew Potts, settle in.\n\nA 23-year-old seamer from Sunderland who looks impressively fit and bowls a heavy ball, Potts has started this summer with Durham like a freight train. Stokes was on the field for three of the six performances that have returned 35 wickets so far and it was an ability to transcend the early season run-fest, plus a career-best seven for 40 against Glamorgan, that convinced the new Test captain that Potts was good to go.\n\nView image in fullscreen Brendon McCullum takes part in a nets session. The captains and head coaches of both sides in this series were all born in New Zealand. Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/Reuters\n\nStokes said: “The one thing that really made my mind up about Potts was when he bowled us to victory against Glamorgan. He turned up on day four with a bit of a stiff side and someone in his situation, with Test selection coming round the corner, he could have just sat back and said: ‘No, I am going to just look after myself here.’ But he didn’t, he ran in and he won the game for Durham.\n\n“That’s the attitude that sets you at the next level and makes you open your eyes that this kid is ready. He’s been phenomenal: he’s an athlete and everything I expect this team to be.”\n\nPotts ahead of Craig Overton – with Jack Leach playing his first home Test since 2019 – means a long tail and, with issues over the top order a hardy perennial, much will come down to the experienced hub of Root, Jonny Bairstow and Stokes on what looks a beige, flat pitch.\n\nQuick Guide Teams for the first Test Show England Crawley, Lees, Pope, Root, Bairstow, Stokes (c), Foakes (wkt), Potts, Leach, Broad, Anderson.

Thank you for your feedback.\n\nRoot will also be adjusting to life back in the ranks but, unlike a good number to attempt this previously, it is a case of trying to keep the runs flowing from his bat after a personally golden 12 months. Stokes, who will not have an official vice-captain at first, intends to seek his advice only when required.\n\nStokes said: “[Root] is always going to be there offering support but also said he doesn’t want to feel like he’s getting in the way. I said the same to him: ‘Mate, just concentrate on your batting now, you don’t have all the extra responsibility on your shoulders. Don’t feel like you have to come to me, just concentrate on getting your runs.’”\n\nThe New Zealand side they meet can be viewed in one of two ways. The tourists have lost two pillars of their top seven through the retirements of Ross Taylor and BJ Watling, while Henry Nicholls makes it a third after contracting Covid-19. Trent Boult is a late arrival from India, Kane Williamson is battling for form after elbow problems and, as well as two drawn home series against South Africa and Bangladesh last season, they lost their last warm-up match against a County Select XI that featured one capped player.\n\nBut then it is worth remembering that last summer, as English minds got into a funk about rest and rotation, New Zealand made six changes to their XI at Edgbaston and still claimed a thumping win and the series 1-0. Will Young and Matt Henry, two of the architects, then stepped aside for the World Test Championship final that followed, demonstrating an enviably deep and ego-free squad at their disposal.\n\nThis is one of a number of Kiwi traits the hosts are unashamedly looking to replicate as, in the words of Stokes, they try to “make England great again”.

We want to win that urn back,” he said.\n\n“We don’t want to be standing still. I want to keep making this team push themselves as hard as they possibly can.\n\n“I don’t think ‘reboot’ is the right word for what we’ve done, but when you’re in a position where you’ve got to make decisions, it solely comes down to what we think is best for the team.\n\n“You sometimes have to put personal relationships and things to the side. There’ll be some decisions I’m sure people might not understand or might be frustrated by and that’s something that I’m absolutely fine with and completely understand.\n\n“I don’t want to say I’m stubborn, but one thing I’m very clear on is that I know that these decisions are best for the team, from my point of view, and that comes with responsibility of being a captain.”\n\nStokes talked up the potential of 20-year-old Shoaib Bashir, pictured (Steven Paston/PA)\n\nBoth Smith and Bashir have been fast-tracked quicker at international level than they have been in domestic cricket, but Stokes is undeterred about following his instincts with the pair.\n\n“In an ideal world, you’d love for the players that you’ve picked in the Test team to also be playing those roles back for their counties,” he said.\n\n“But come (Wednesday), come the rest of the week and the rest of the summer, out there (on the pitch) is where it’s going to count.\n\n“We give everyone the freedom to go out and express themselves, whether they’ve had a lot of cricket on their back or not.\n\n“Jamie and Bash are here, obviously in a different role than what they have been doing for the counties, but I don’t see that being too much of an issue because they’re both class players.\n\n“We’re very, very excited by what Jamie can offer to us and this team. He fits in perfectly with everything that we want and he’s deserved his place by runs alone, I think.\n\n“Bash is 6ft 4in and has a lot of individual traits that we feel that we can bring out.

The partnership directly influenced the shopping habits of consumers. Research released by ITV shows that 53% of viewers who were aware of the partnership bought secondhand, or “pre-loved” clothes in the past three months. Since the announcement of the partnership last May, the site had 1,600% more searches for “pre-loved clothes” compared with the previous year, while Google searches for the same phrase were up 170%. Its viewing figures make these numbers significant – 5 million people tuned in to the final in 2022.\n\nIn the summer, Love Island contestants wore their own clothes as well as secondhand clothes sourced on eBay, and chosen by the celebrity stylist Amy Bannerman. This season the idea has been extended to other initiatives recently started by the site. In addition to general secondhand items chosen by Bannerman, contestants will also have access to pieces from the eBay Imperfects range – new clothes sold for up to 60% off because of defects, from streetwear brands including Off-White and North Face. They can also choose secondhand trainers that have been authenticated by the site’s “authenticity guarantee” launched last July.\n\nResold streetwear and trainers – also on sites such as StockX and Grailed – are central to the style of the 16- to 34-year-old demographic typically watching Love Island, while the move to vintage is in line with their wider shopping habits. Research conducted late last year by the Boston Consulting Group and resale site Vestiarie showed that generation Z consumers were most likely to buy (31%) and sell (44%) secondhand items, with millennials close behind. A reduced environmental impact and cheaper prices have been cited as reasons behind the trend.\n\n“The partnership has already shown its impact with [Love] Islanders and our pre-loved ambassador, Tasha Ghouri, demonstrating their true style and flair with pre-loved looks,” said Kirsty Keoghan, the global general manager of fashion at eBay. “We’re very excited to continue this conversation and show the nation how good pre-loved really can look.”\n\nGhouri, arguably the most fashionable contestant of the last series, has since become eBay’s first fashion ambassador. She has posted about vintage items to her 1.5 million Instagram followers, worn vintage to events and launched a store of “pre-loved sparkle” on eBay in the run-up to Christmas.\n\nNot all of those associated with Love Island have ditched fashion brands, however. After the show last year, the winner Ekin-Su Cülcüloğl signed a deal with Oh Polly – rated “we avoid” by sustainability rating site Good on You and reported to be worth £1m. Her fellow contestant Gemma Owen has since signed up with PrettyLittleThing, in a six-figure deal.", "authors": ["Lauren Cochrane"], "publish_date": "2023/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/14ou2jj/original_director_of_hidden_love_abandoned_the/", "title": "Original director of Hidden Love abandoned the project because he ..."}, {"url": "https://www.camillafitzsimons.com/post/stick-or-twist-the-love-island-dilemma", "title": "'Stick or twist': The Love Island dilemma. Blog #4", "text": "Camilla Fitzsimons. Maynooth University, Ireland.\n\nI watch Love Island. There I said it, I’m a feminist and I watch Love Island.\n\nSeason after season, for one sacred hour each evening, I tune into ITV’s summer dating show where - for those of you not familiar with the format, a group of singletons, or ‘Islanders’, are thrown together in an apparent quest for true love. The show usually starts with an original cast of around ten people who must ‘couple-up’ with each other. But no sooner have they learned each other’s names, the lives of these ‘OGs' gets regularly interrupted by the arrival of new Islanders, or ‘bombshells’, who are strategically 'thrown in' to stir up the group dynamic. Regular 're-couplings' enable new partnerships to form. Because Islanders don't know who will arrive next, there is a constant air of instability as people often hold off on their initial attraction in case someone even more gorgeous than their current 'partner' walks through that door. Half way through the show, contestants are put through 'the ultimate test' when men and women are separated with one group or the other sent to a separate villa (Casa Amor), where they spend time mingling with a brand new crop of 'Islanders'. They must then decide whether to 'stick' in their existing couple, or 'twist' by bringing one of the newer contestants into the villa.\n\nAcross eight weeks, as many as 30-40 contestants ‘crack on’ with each other, compete in challenges, and entertain us with their daily exploits. There’s audience participation too as, for viewers based in the UK, regular public votes help decide who gets ‘dumped’ from the villa. The public also chooses the winning couple who then split a cash prize of £50,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s lots of things to like about Love Island; the escapism, the unpredictability of often ill-matched couples, and the pure fun of it all. And then there’s the romance. There have been Love Island marriages and even Love Island babies. There’s also the sense of community it inspires through hours of wrap-around content via dedicated podcasts, Reddit discussion boards, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter. Together we cast judgement on complete strangers, crave inside scoops from 'dumped' ex-Islanders, laugh at contestant's good humour, revel in their mistakes, appraise their behaviours, comment on their style, and speculate about their romantic compatibility. It's great.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m not alone in my guilty pleasure. Nearly three and a half a million mostly female viewers tuned in to watch Ekin-su Cülcüloğlu and Davide Sanclimenti be crowned the 2022 winners; and that’s just the ITV estimates. I cheered aloud when they beat Luca Bish and Gemma Owen - daughter of Michael Owen aka Doughnuts from The Masked Singer UK season 3 (or legendary English footballer and Ballon d’Or winner, depending on your interests). Love Island is so popular, more people apply to be Islanders than apply for university at Oxford or Cambridge .\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, there’s nothing ‘real’ about the show, something that can be said for much reality TV. After all, what’s ordinary about locking people away in a sun-baked Spanish villa, surrounding them with cameras then directing them in what they can and cannot do. Although not technically scripted, most fans understand that showrunners and producers mingle amongst Islanders. Viewers appreciate their power in selecting what to air and what not to air as they carefully curate storylines by interfering with Islander dynamics with the express purpose of increasing the levels of drama. We know about ' the voice of god ' intercom system that guides and even reprimands Islanders for such seemingly innocuous actions as sitting in the wrong part of the villa or talking too much about a topic deemed boring. Let's face it, if producer prompting didn’t exist, there wouldn’t be a show to air.\n\nViewers also know that contestants don’t enter to find true love rather the reality TV contestant dream revolves around Instagram followings and that all important influencer identity. When Molly Mae Hague (season 5, runner up) became brand ambassador for PrettyLittle Thing (PLT), she reportedly received £0.5 million for the trouble.\n\nIt’s not just older viewers like me that understand the artificiality of the show. Research by relationships and sexuality educators Jannette Porter and Kay Standing found 13-21yr olds mostly watch the show for the fun of it and “were critical of the 'fakeness' of the relationships shown and the fact that it is a game show with a financial incentive”. The researchers also played-down media hype about the damage the show can do to young, seemingly impressionable viewers claiming people learn how to behave from a variety of sources and mostly from what they experience at home.[1]\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what's the dilemma?\n\nWatching Love Island doesn’t mean I’m blind to the shows well-documented ethical shortcomings, weaknesses that no amount of jokes about ‘feminism leaving my body’ can excuse. Some changes have been made such as the decision to ditch fast-fashion sponsors and 'recouple' with online marketplace e-bay (more about this later). However, little has been done to address other important issues such as the show’s hyper-cis-heteronormativity which privileges straightness and gender-binaries as the norm. When challenged on the exclusion of LGBTQI+ cast-members one producer blamed logistical difficulties in forming couples. Former-Islander Katie Salmon (season 2) must have missed that memo when she chose to 'couple-up' with fellow female contestant Sophie Grandon .\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of body diversity - there is none. No woman above a size 12 has ever been cast and the default islander is perfectly groomed, taut and tanned. The job description for men likely demands regular trips to the Island gym to maintain muscular biceps and perfectly chiselled abs. Again producers justify this by claiming (rather bizarrely) that contestants \" need to be attracted to each other \". Physical attractiveness as the number one criterion on deciding who to ‘graft for’ is repeatedly reinforced by Islanders who describe ‘their type’ as either ‘blonde’ or ‘brunette’. Personality traits are rarely mentioned. This narrow framing of desirability fuels persistent accusations of racism. It took four seasons before Samira Mighty became the first Black woman to be cast. She left the show prematurely and of her own accord following weeks of rejection from fellow, mostly white, male islanders. A similar pattern recurred in season 7 when Black female cast members endured repeated declarations that their potential suitors ‘preferred blondes’ - an epitome of beauty that endorses racist aesthetics. As bell hooks puts it “within white supremacist culture, a female must be white to occupy the space of sacred femininity, and she must also be blond”[2]. Former Irish contestant Yewande Biala explains the impact this had on her like this,\n\n“I personally struggled a lot because every man who came into the villa said their type was ‘blonde hair and blue eyes, I just sat there like, 'obviously I missed the memo because I’m not blonde and I definitely won’t have blue eyes.' It was a struggle and I cried so much.” [3]\n\nIf homophobia, body-shaming and racism aren’t reason enough to switch off, there’s the persistent division of female contestants along that ever present Madonna-whore complex . Take how Kem Cetinay (season 3, winner) singled out some women as people he could ‘take home to meet his mum’. Or how paramedic Paige Thorne (season 8) was persistently described as ‘wifey material’ for her seemingly passive demeanour. At the other end of the spectrum there are repeated criticisms of women for innocuous actions that pale in comparison to much of what their male counterparts get up to. This ‘slut shaming’ has leaked beyond the show. In 2016 Zara Holland (season 2) was de-crowned as Miss GB for having an intimate relationship with Alex Bowen. In 2022, the spinoff show 'Love Island Aftersun' allowed a regular contributor Darren Harriott to disrespectfully admonish innocent behaviour by eventual winner Ekin-Su in a most derogatory tone. His sexually explicit comment, encouraged by the show’s host Laura Whitmore, sparked almost 500 complaints to TV watchdog Ofcom (one of which came from me). Alicia Denby sums things up neatly when she writes,\n\n\"the stigmatization of sex-positive women in Love Island demonstrates the existence of a sexual double standard wherein male contestants are celebrated for their sexual prowess, while female contestants are shamed and deemed unruly, by virtue of their sexual dominance.\" [4]\n\nThere have also been complains about abusive behaviour by female contestants most infamously an angry outburst by Faye Winters (season 7) which resulted in a record nearly 24,000 Ofcom complaints (again including one by me!).\n\nAn ongoing discussion-point surrounding most reality TV shows is whether they create or merely reflect much wider, deep-rooted social problems. Love Island doesn’t create sexism, misogyny, ableism and racism and these aren't simply individual traits held by bad people. The reality is that these 'isms' are stitched into the fabric of society permeating our education, health, welfare, justice and media institutions. These systems are extremely powerful socialising agents that ultimately determine what each of us can achieve in society. The discriminations created aren’t independent of each other rather they are intersectional meaning they interlock and feed off each other. Black women fare worse in the villa because they have to deal with the compounding impacts of sexism and racism. In fact the beauty writer Sheilla Mamona is amongst those to argue Love Island does Black women a favour by not casting them, supposedly saving them the humiliation of competing amidst “a western society [that] often idolises Eurocentric beauty ideals above all”.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that we don't have some agency and that people shouldn’t challenge bad behaviour just as Rosie Williams did (season 4) when she gathered the Islanders around so they could witness her call out Adam Collard for playing women off each other .\n\n\n\n\n\nReasons to 'twist'\n\nOne reason to stop watching is because it is not enough to leave it to Islanders to address each others actions rather the long-term solution to inequality means changing the structures that organise the way we live, even when we are locked away in a sun-baked villa. This involves turning our gaze towards the dominant cultures within mainstream television; a for-profit domain which occupies a dwindling but nonetheless dominant position in popular culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are other, often serious accusations about how the shows makers have acted in a way that detrimentally impacts contestant well-being. Rachel Finni, Love Island’s first Black ‘bombshell’, has accused producers of “playing her” so they could stave off real-time criticism about a lack of diversity. She explains how she was suddenly introduced to the villa, then immediately put into an unenviable predicament when she was forced to choose between Brad and Chuggs (both white) who clearly weren’t interested in anything outside the blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty standard discussed earlier. Rachel explains,\n\n\"I don’t ever want to come across as if I’m bitter but … don’t put me in a show where you make it uncomfortable for people to say ‘I like dark hair, I like dark features’ … I got told by people that work at ITV, that I got put in at that time because there was so much backlash for lack of diversity. Bear in mind these people know what my type is, they know what Brad and Chuggs type is, but they gave me that entrance because they thought, ‘okay this is going to shut people up’, they were just ticking boxes. They had someone who was disabled, tick, someone who was from the NHS, tick, two people who were Asian, tick. They only care about ticking boxes.” [6]\n\nShe chose Brad, who promptly rejected her for another, 'blonder', new arrival. Rachel stayed just eleven days and never managed to make a meaningfully connection with another contestant. It seems clear that the producer's efforts to respond to critics lacked any concerted effort to truly address deep-seated racism.\n\nThere have been other examples of real-time neglect from a show that interferes with almost every other aspect of Islander’s lives. Take their failure to respond to live statements by domestic charity organisations about behaviours the affects of which are notoriously difficult to articulate when you are in the thick of it. Promises to 'do more' doesn't help the contestant who is actively kept in harm's way. For example, although Jacques O'Neill (season 8) did eventually leave the villa, this was a full two weeks after he labelled Paige Thorne \"pathetic\" when she attempted to express her feelings. His abusive actions let to numerous Ofcom complaints but no immediate action by producers.\n\nAs Orlaith Condon, creator and host of the podcast My Pod on Paper, put it,\n\n\n\n\n\n“We all learned about gaslighting on Love Island some four or five years ago, many of us for the first time and we have been calling it out in many different scenarios and varying levels of intensity since then, this is not a new issue, we’ve seen it every year…We are seeing behaviours here, constantly throughout the whole series, in the same kinds of situations all the time and we are seeing no acknowledgement of the wrongdoing at all, and that to me is just infuriating to watch.” [7]\n\nLove Island has also come up against criticism for inadequate post-show supports. To date there have been three suicides associated with the show: ex-Islanders Sophie Grandon (season 2) and Mike Thalassitis (season 3); and former host Caroline Flack with their deaths reportedly leading to improvements in the type and duration of supports ex-Islanders receive. Other reality TV shows have also been associated with suicides including the death of a contestant who failed a lie detector test on The Jeremy Kyle Show. Love Island promptly dumped that aspect of their show in response.\n\nAlthough the reasons behind any suicide are likely complex, Sophie’s death has been linked to post show struggles in coming to terms with being catapulted from obscurity to high levels of media attention. Her boyfriend Aaron Armstrong also died by suicide soon after her death. It has also been reported that Mike Thalassitis had financial problems , an important consideration given repeated implications that Islanders can make millions once they leave. The reality is that this only happens for a select few. For every Molly Mae, who is estimated to be worth £6 million, there are hundreds of Islanders who earn little more than the c£250 a week they are paid whilst participating in the show. There can also be a financial cost to Islanders. For example, Jade Aflick (season 6) reportedly spent £3,500 getting aesthetically ready for a show she lasted just three days in.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking money may be hit-and-miss for contestants but we should never forget that it is the ultimate aim of the television corporation. One of its most successful financial endeavours has been a toxic relationship with a fast-fashion industry that manufactures cheap, on-trend clothing that are designed to be snapped up at the height of their popularity, then discarded soon afterwards. Love Island doesn't simply buy fast-fashion, it drives the industry forward. It has even enabled interactive sales whilst the show airs. In 2020 the underwhelming winter show delivered huge profits for I Saw It First who ran the Love Island look instantaneous campaign.\n\nThe increase in sales the show generates is unprecedented. When Dani Dyer (season 4, winner) donned a stylish crochet dress by the brand Misguided sales soured by 9,300 percent . Not to be outdone, competitor Boohoo made three out of four female finalists from season five their brand ambassadors. In return, these women: Molly Mae Hague, Maura Higgins and India Reynolds, push sales of their disposable clothing to millions of Instagram followers.\n\n\n\n\n\nFast-fashion causes significant damage to the planet. When Dani Dyer-esque dresses were discarded, many of them likely ended up in the ever expanding clothes mountains that have become a permanent feature of some poorer countries most of which are in West Africa and particularly Ghana .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fast-fashion industry is also guilty of exploiting its mostly female workforce. The terms and conditions of employment for some of the industry's lowest paid workers was starkly revealed to the world in 2013 when the Rana Plaza in Dhaka collapse d killing 1,132 garment workers, many of who had asked to leave in the days leading up to the collapse because they feared for their safety. In the UK, a factory owned by the Boohoo Group were recently exposed as paying workers £3-4 pounds per hour .\n\nReasons to 'stick'\n\nOne reason to stick is its potential to be what Jessica Bateman describes as “ the best educational tool we have right now about healthy and unhealthy relationships. Hands down ”. I get where she is coming from. More people will have learned about feminism from a different Camilla (Thurlow, season 3) than from me when she explained to Johnny why we still need feminism ; a clip that has been watched nearly 650,000 times on YouTube.\n\nWe need all the educational tools we can get given how dreadful the Irish sex education curriculum is. There is practically no focus on consent, scant, if any attention to the commercialisation of erotica, and an ongoing exclusion of people whose genders and sexualities fall outside of hetero-norms. I can definitely imagine the usefulness of a problem-posing approach that could deconstruct excerpts in well-managed, participatory learning spaces.\n\nSome popular culture content creators have filled a gap by creating educational materials themselves. For example, in 2022, the podcast My Pod on Paper broadcast a bonus episode with Women’s Aid Ireland’s too into you campaign which educates mostly young women about intimate relationship abuse.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Islanders also use their platform positively and with an educational dimension. Take Dr Alex George (season 4), who entered the show with just 280 Instagram followers, then left with over one million. Alex did initially embrace monitory opportunities by signing ambassador deals with car and TV companies . However, he returned to medicine during the pandemic and worked in the frontline despite being one of the most followed doctors on the internet. In an interview with Pandora Skyes and Sirin Kale, Alex explains how rather that plug the many products he could have sponsored, he used his Instagram to post positive mental health messages. He discloses, \"I could have made lots of money doing a night club PA [public appearance] and I haven't even done one. Because it’s just not me\". And continues,\n\nWhen the pandemic came along, I felt a real sense of responsibility...it was almost like a moment of like, this is my calling, this was to be my one job - to be a voice to young people. I am now working in a role as youth mental health ambassador, that is my priority. I am aware that I am able to influence in a way that is genuinely meaningful and can help people\" [9]\n\nOther ex-Islanders have used their platform to empower people and shine a light on the impacts of discrimination. In 2022, Yewande Biale drew from her experience of racism in the show to write a book called Reclaimed which, amongst other things, explores white privilege, racism, colour-blindness, and black-fishing.[10] Tasha Ghouri (season 8), the shows first Deaf contestant, consistently uses YouTube and Instagram to education people about her \"superpower\". Her 1.4 million fans have learned about cochlear implants and the challenges of lip-reading. Her partnership with the chocolate maker Cadbury informs people about \"the missed moments experienced by the Deaf community \", and teaches people simple British Sign Language phrases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also some signs of change regarding fast-fashion and Love Island’s new partnership with e-bay is great news. But this falls short of what is needed given that ex-contestants continue to sign lucrative deals. Some have bucked the trend. Tasha signed a brand deal with e-bay and Indiya Pollack (season 8) is the new ambassador for PLT Marketplace. However, PTL Marketplace has been accused of greenwashing meaning they present a veneer of change whilst nothing substantive is actually altered. E-bay also continues to mostly trade in new goods.\n\nPerhaps next year's show will double down on its newfound eco-values and make fashion deals less appealing overall and not leave this responsibility to ex-Islander Brett Staniland (season 5) who staged a protest outside the launch of one of Molly Mae's fashion lines .\n\nWhether by accident or design, the show does raise important issues that, at the moment, are left to podcasters, fans, past-Islanders, and people like me to analyse. What if producers embraced this role too and not leave it to fans to point out the irony of having a Deaf contestant but no interpreters. Why are clear warnings not given for gender-based and racist abuse? After all, the confessional nature of the beach-hut has all the hallmarks of the Big Brother Chair. The same chair where, in 2015, Ken Morley was formally warned for persistent racist and misogynistic behaviours. He was eventually thrown off the show in part because of 200 Ofcom complaints, a mere fraction of the 2,000 complains about the bullying Tasha endured. Other reality dating shows have embraced this opportunity to name and shame. 'Married at First Sight Australia' (a show that is far from perfect) have called out toxic masculinity by contestants a number of times. In this clip they publicly admonish one 'groom' for “classic stereotypical gaslighting behaviour”.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpportunities to do things differently are endless and would allow fans like me to focus on the fun stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\nWill I stick? Probably. What about you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you think you are in an abusive relationship and don't know where to turn, contact Women's Aid at 1800 341 900 or text 087 959 7980.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Camilla Fitzsimons is an Associate Professor in Adult and Community Education at Maynooth University.

Clothing from eBay's online second hand marketplace was worn by contestants as they descended on an exotic location to find love.\n\nSearches for ‘pre-loved clothing’ soared by 1,600 per cent on eBay after the show aired.\n\nNew data from eBay reveals that demand is still strong, with 49 per cent of Brits planning to buy pre-loved fashion in 2023. Those aged 18 to 34 are most open to buying second hand clothing, with 74 per cent planning to do so compared to 31 per cent of over 55s.\n\nFor season 9, 'Love Island' has once again teamed up with eBay to drive conversations on sustainability and encourage shoppers to be more eco-conscious about their wardrobes.\n\nWhy is pre-loved fashion growing in popularity?\n\nClothes and footwear are responsible for water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and landfill. With the rise of fast fashion, the quantity of clothes being produced and thrown away has skyrocketed.\n\nShopping for pre-loved items saves both money and the environment. 50 per cent of survey respondents said they shopped second hand because it's cheaper, while 48 per cent cited environmental reasons.\n\neBay estimates that if every shopper bought one pre-loved fashion item instead of buying new in a month, the UK could divert 6,000 tonnes from disposal - the equivalent to over 260,000 filled suitcases.\n\nIn the EU, of the 5.8 million tonnes of textiles that consumers discard every year, only a quarter is recycled according to the European Commission. Friends of the Earth Europe reports that the remaining 4.3 million tonnes are dumped. That's equivalent to 60 garbage truckloads of clothes being burned or buried in landfill every minute.\n\nHow will pre-loved clothing feature in 'Love Island' Series 9?\n\nIslanders will be dressed by celebrity stylist Amy Bannerman, who has worked with celebrities such as Dua Lipa, Rita Ora, Lena Dunham and Jonathan Van Ness\n\nShe will fill a shared wardrobe in the iconic 'Love Island' villa with second hand items from eBay, following four themes: ‘Tutti Frutti’, ‘Business vs Party’, ‘Dressed up Denim’ and ‘Heavy Metal’.\n\nThe e-commerce platform is also taking the opportunity to promote its authenticated sneakers and Imperfects range by incorporating them into the show.\n\nSome branded items which are sold above certain thresholds on the platform are vetted by industry experts for authenticity in a bid to build consumer trust.\n\nThe platform describes its Imperfects range as the equivalent of supermarkets' 'wonky veg' initiative. It offers clothes, shoes and accessories which are considered new, but with defects, from over 100 high-street and high-end designers including North Face, Off White, Puma, Fila and Timberland at up to 60 per cent off.\n\nDefects may include small scuffs or marks, a button missing, a loose thread or ex-display items that cannot be sold at full price.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.askamanager.org/2022/01/the-new-hire-who-showed-up-is-not-the-same-person-we-interviewed.html", "title": "the new hire who showed up is not the same person we interviewed ...", "text": "A reader writes:\n\nThis is a situation currently unfolding at my husband’s office so I’m a very amused bystander and thought I’d get your opinion on this craziness.\n\nMy husband works in IT and is on the leadership team at a midsized private company. He was part of a panel that recently interviewed a number of folks for an open position on his team. They are entirely remote. They had a few candidates for a first and second round, and had one make it to a third final round before an offer. “John” accepted the offer and started last week!\n\nExcept … it’s not the John my husband remembers. My husband was confused and said the following things were odd:\n\n– John has different hair and now wears glasses.\n\n– John is talking extensively about working in a garage because his three children and wife are home. In the interview, he made references to being single and was visibly in an indoor desk area.\n\n– John can’t answer a number of questions that they previously discussed in the interview, things pretty pivotal to the position.\n\n– Husband describes John as being aloof and pretty timid whereas John was confident and articulate when they interviewed him.\n\nHe is convinced this is not the person they hired. I agreed that all those things taken together make this very odd but each one could have a valid explanation. I told him the most likely explanation is the hiring committee simply mixed up the candidates (or HR did) and the wrong John was offered and accepted. He agreed but said since only one candidate made it to the third round, that is really unlikely (other candidates had already been sent rejections before the third round even occurred). He’s confident they couldn’t have been mixed up.\n\nAll of this is a bit moot as my husband is in his notice period and will be moving to a new company in a few weeks … but he feels like he is going crazy. So my question is … is this a thing?! In a now mostly virtual world, are people perhaps paying people to conduct interviews for them?!?\n\nThe situation is actively unfolding so I’m sure I’ll have updates. The less mature side of me wants him to start planting fake references to the interview conversations they had to see if John bites, but I digress.\n\nAfter receiving this letter, I got updates. Many updates (probably because I greeted each one enthusiastically and requested more)! So let’s do those first and then get to the question.\n\nUpdate 1\n\n11:57 am\n\nA very quick update!\n\nMy husband just came out of his office and said he has a text from his boss “Holly” on his personal cell because she didn’t want it on the company network. She wants to know if he thinks John is acting a lot different than the John they hired. He responded and told her all of his suspicions with the caveat that he didn’t want to accuse him of anything but something is very off. She too thinks it’s unlikely candidates were mixed up because she has his resume and John claims all the same work history/credentials as the John they interviewed.\n\nThey are on a call with HR as I type this. Unclear if they are working out an error by the hiring committee /HR or unraveling fraud. More to come.\n\nAlas, my planting fake call-backs idea had no time to come to fruition.\n\nUpdate 2\n\n12:25 pm\n\nHusband just got off a call with Holly, their HR business partner, and the internal recruiter who sent the offer. They confirmed the right candidate was offered a job and agreed many things were odd. (Another oddity revealed on that phone call … John didn’t know who Holly was; she had to reintroduce herself and he asked about her role … Holly was on two of three rounds of interviews and they extensively reviewed their org chart and her role.)\n\nThey are currently speaking with their legal team to discuss options and when to bring John into the mix to try to explain.\n\nUpdate 3\n\n1:43 pm\n\nIt’s definitely been a crazy morning! They are waiting to hear back from legal — I think they are weighing whether they confront John and let him try to explain or let him go anyway. He either lied about his identity or lied about his experience since he’s unable to speak about the basics of the job now so regardless it seems like he will be gone. I will keep you updated on what he learns next!\n\nHusband in a rabbit hole of research now and apparently this fake interviewing is a thing (the job in question is a mulesoft architect). Bizarre!\n\nUpdate 4\n\n3:13 pm\n\nThey heard back from legal … who are less than thrilled about the situation! They approved HR to have a conversation with John regarding what has been reported (more in the vein of “there’s been some concerns about performance and you overselling abilities” and less of the We Think You Are a Liar route).\n\nIn the meantime, legal approved security to put a trace on John’s computer to review if there have been outside messages or if his work is being completed with outside help or on a different computer altogether. My husband said the general consensus among the group on the call is that the talk with HR is going to send up a quick red flag and John is likely to resign claiming a poor fit rather than get caught committing or admitting fraud.\n\nHopefully another fun update soon! My husband is getting sick of me sitting against his office door eavesdropping :)\n\nUpdate 5\n\n5:07 pm\n\nI think my last update for a while: as soon as HR got on the call with him, before they could get through their first question, John said the words “I quit” and hung up the calls. He has since been unreachable!!\n\nSo good riddance John. Their security teams are trying to discover what all he downloaded, if they’ll be able to get their equipment back, is John really his real name, etc. !!\n\nIncredibly bizarre situation. Hoping it was a failed case of trying to get a job and not trying to steal company info but who knows — they may never!\n\nFirst, thank you for this saga, which I found highly diverting.\n\nSo yeah, in response to whether this is a thing … as your husband found, the internet claims it’s a thing, particularly in IT jobs and largely because of the increase in virtual interviewing. The idea is that one person interviews and another takes the job, or one person interviews while another person feeds them answers. You could short-circuit the first category by having people show I.D. at the start of virtual interviews, but the second category is harder and you’d need to address it by being forthright and direct if the person you hire doesn’t seem to have the skills they appeared to have in the interview … which is something good managers should do regardless, but it’s easy to fall into thinking maybe the person is just still adjusting to the role and then suddenly you’re two months in with someone who was never going to be able to do the job because they Cyrano de Bergerac’d their interview.\n\nRead a final update to this letter here.", "authors": ["Ask A Manager", "Alison Green"], "publish_date": "2022/01/31"}, {"url": "https://mikerowe.com/2012/09/the-first-four-years-are-the-hardest/", "title": "The First Four Years Are The Hardest… – Mike Rowe"}, {"url": "https://www.financialsamurai.com/the-dark-side-of-early-retirement-risks-dangers/", "title": "The Dark Side Of Early Retirement: The Downsides Of Not Working", "text": "", "authors": ["Financial Samurai", "About The Author", "Sam Started Financial Samurai In To Help Make Sense Of Financial Chaos.

The Guardian noted that the character’s new status was legally defined after a company, set up by the creator of the BBC comedy, won its copyright battle with the operators of an “interactive theatrical dining experience”, Only Fools the (Cushty) Dining Experience. The judge said that the character of Del Boy was a literary work, and that each script of the series was a dramatic work.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Does the World Need It ...", "text": "We banked $1,144 in total sales. As our staff left that night, we waved across the room to one another with a strange mixture of longing and eye-rolling, still in the self-conscious phase of having to act so distant from one another, all of us still so unaware of what was coming. Then, as I was running a last tray of glassware before mopping the floors, Ashley leaned over to announce: Hey, he just called it. De Blasio. Its a shutdown. You beat it by five hours, babe. The next day, a Monday, Ashley started assembling 30 boxes of survival-food kits for the staff. She packed Ziploc bags of nuts, rice, pasta, cans of curry paste and cartons of eggs, while music played from her cellphone tucked into a plastic quart container an old line-cook trick for amplifying sound. I texted a clip of her mini-operation to José Andrés, who called immediately with encouragement: We will win this together! We feed the world one plate at a time! Ashley had placed a last large order from our wholesaler: jarred peanut butter, canned tuna, coconut milk and other unlikely items that had never appeared on our order history. And our account rep, Marie Elena Corrao we met when I was her first account 20 years ago; she came to our wedding in 2016 put the order through without even clearing her throat, sending the truck to a now-shuttered business. She knew as well as we did that it would be a long while before the bill was paid. Leo, from the family-owned butchery weve used for 20 years, Pinos Prime Meat Market, called not to diplomatically inquire about our plans but to immediately offer tangibles: What meats do you ladies need for the home? He offered this even though he knew that there were 30 days worth of his invoices in a pile on my desk, totaling thousands of dollars. And all day a string of neighborhood regulars passed by on the sidewalk outside and made heart hands at us through the locked French doors. It turned out that abruptly closing a restaurant is a weeklong, full-time job. I was bombarded with an astonishing volume of texts. The phone rang throughout the day, overwhelmingly well-wishers and regretful cancellations, but there was a woman who apparently hadnt followed the coronavirus news. She cut me off in the middle of my greeting with, Yeah, you guys open for brunch? Then she hung up before I could even finish saying, Take care out there. Ashley spent almost three days packing the freezers, sorting the perishables in the walk-in into categories like Today would be good! or This will be good for the long haul! We tried burying par-cooked chickens under a tight seal of duck fat to see if we could keep them perfectly preserved in their airtight coffins. She pickled the beets and the brussels sprouts, churned quarts of heavy cream into butter. I imagined I would tackle my other problems quickly. I emailed my banker. For sales taxes, liquor invoices and impending rent, I hoped to apply for a modest line of credit to float me through this crisis. I thought having run $2.5 million to $3 million through my bank each year for the past two decades would leave me poised to see a line of credit quickly, but then I remembered that I switched banks in the past year. Everyone in my industry encouraged me to apply for an S.B.A. disaster loan I estimated we wouldnt need much; for 14 days, $50,000 so I sent in my query.\n\nOn the night before I laid off all 30 of my employees, I dreamed that my two children had perished, buried alive in dirt, while I dug in the wrong place, just five feet away from where they were actually smothered. I turned and spotted the royal blue heel of my youngests socked foot poking out of the black soil only after it was too late. For 10 days, everyone in my orbit had been tilting one way one hour, the other the next. Ten days of being waterboarded by the news, by tweets, by friends, by my waiters. Of being inundated by texts from fellow chefs and managers former employees, now at the helm of their own restaurants but still eager for guidance. Of gentle but nervous pleas from my operations manager to consider signing up with a third-party delivery service like Caviar. Of being rattled even by my own wife, Ashley, and her anxious compulsion to act, to reduce our restaurants operating hours, to close at 9 p.m., cut shifts. With no clear directive from any authority public schools were still open I spent those 10 days sorting through the conflicting chatter, trying to decide what to do. And now I understood abruptly: I would lay everybody off, even my wife. Prune, my Manhattan restaurant, would close at 11:59 p.m. on March 15. I had only one piece of unemotional data to work with: the checking-account balance. If I triaged the collected sales tax that was sitting in its own dedicated savings account and left unpaid the stack of vendor invoices, I could fully cover this one last week of payroll. By the time of the all-staff meeting after brunch that day, I knew I was right. After a couple of weeks of watching the daily sales dwindle a $12,141 Saturday to a $4,188 Monday to a $2,093 Thursday it was a relief to decide to pull the parachute cord. I didnt want to have waited too long, didnt want to crash into the trees. Our sous chef FaceTimed in, as did our lead line cook, while nearly everyone else gathered in the dining room. I looked everybody in the eye and said, Ive decided not to wait to see what will happen; I encourage you to call first thing in the morning for unemployment, and you have a weeks paycheck from me coming. After the meeting, there was some directionless shuffling. Should we collect our things? Grab our knives? Stay and have a drink? There was still one last dinner, so four of us Ashley and I; our general manager, Anna; and Jake, a beloved line cook worked the last shift at Prune for who knows how long. Some staff members remained behind to eat with one another, spending their money in house. As word trickled out, some long-ago alumnae reached out to place orders for meals they would never eat. From Lauren Kois, who waited tables at Prune all through her Ph.D. program and is now an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Alabama: 2 dark and stormiesshrimp w anchovyfried oysters (were pretending its a special tonight)Leo Steen Jurassic Chenin Blancskate wingtreviso saladpotatoes in duck fatbrothy beansbreton butter cake2 black coffees 50 percent TIP Ashley worked the grill station and cold appetizers, while also bartending and expediting. Anna waited and hosted and answered the phone. Jake worked all 10 burners alone. I was in a yellow apron handling the dish pit, clearing the tables and running bus tubs, and I broke into tears for a second when I learned of Koiss order. The word family is thrown around in restaurants for good reason.\n\nGlobalMarketsNew York [After we closed down Prune, we diligently conserved our resources until we didnt.] In the meantime, I made a phone call to Ken, my insurance broker of 20 years, who explained in his patient, technical, my-hands-are-tied voice that this coronavirus business interruption wouldnt likely be covered. He intended to file for damages, as he would if this shutdown had been mandated because of a nearby flood or a fire, but he doubted I would get any money. That afternoon, I saw the courtesy email from our workers-comp carrier that the next installment of our payment plan would be drafted automatically from our bank in six days. Knowing the balance, I snorted to myself:Good luck with that.I called Ken about this, and he got them to postpone the draw. And then, finally, three weeks of adrenaline drained from me. I checked all the pilot lights and took out the garbage; I stopped swimming so hard against the mighty current and let it carry me out. I had spent 20 years in this place, beginning when I was a grad student fresh out of school, through marriage and children and divorce and remarriage, with funerals and first dates in between; I knew its walls and light switches and faucets as well I knew my own body. It was dark outside when Ashley and I finally rolled down the gates and walked home. Prune is a crampedand lively bistro in Manhattans East Village, with a devoted following and a tight-knit crew. I opened it in 1999. It has only 14 tables, which are jammed in so close together that not infrequently you put down your glass of wine to take a bite of your food and realize its on your neighbors table. Many friendships have started this way. What was I imagining 20 years ago when I was working all day, every day at a catering job while staying up all night every night, writing menus and sketching the plating of dishes, scrubbing the walls and painting the butter-yellow trim inside what would become Prune? Id seen the padlocked space, formerly a failed French bistro, when it was decrepit: cockroaches crawling over the sticky Pernod bottles behind the bar and rat droppings carpeting the floors. But even in that moment, gasping for air through the T-shirt I had pulled up over my mouth, I could see vividly what it could become, the intimate dinner party I would throw every night in this charming, quirky space. I was already lighting the candles and filling the jelly jars with wine. I would cook there much the way I cooked at home: whole roasted veal breast and torn lettuces in a well-oiled wooden bowl, a ripe cheese after dinner, none of the aggressively conceptual or architectural food then trendy among aspirational chefs but also none of the roulades and miniaturized bites Id been cranking out as a freelancer in catering kitchens.\n\nAt that point New York didnt have an ambitious and exciting restaurant on every block, in every unlikely neighborhood, operating out of impossibly narrow spaces. There was no Eater, no Instagram, no hipster Brooklyn food scene. If you wanted something expert to eat, you dined in Manhattan. For fine dining, with plush armchairs and a captain who ran your table wearing an Armani suit, you went uptown; for the buzzy American brasserie with bentwood cane-backed chairs and waiters in long white aprons, you stayed downtown. There was no serious restaurant that would allow a waiter to wear a flannel shirt or hire a sommelier with face piercings and neck tattoos. The East Village had Polish and Ukrainian diners, falafel stands, pizza parlors, dive bars and vegetarian cafes. There was only one notable noodle spot. Momofuku opened five years after Prune. I meant to create a restaurant that would serve as delicious and interesting food as the serious restaurants elsewhere in the city but in a setting that would welcome, and not intimidate, my ragtag friends and my neighbors all the East Village painters and poets, the butches and the queens, the saxophone player on the sixth floor of my tenement building, the performance artists doing their brave naked work up the street at P.S. 122. I wanted a place you could go after work or on your day off if you had only a line cooks paycheck but also a line cooks palate. And I thought it might be a more stable way to earn a living than the scramble of freelancing Id done up until then. Like most chefs who own these small restaurants that have now proliferated across the whole city, Ive been driven by the sensory, the human, the poetic and the profane not by money or a thirst to expand. Even after seven nights a week for two decades, I am still stopped in my tracks every time my bartenders snap those metal lids onto the cocktail shakers and start rattling the ice like maracas. I still close my eyes for a second, taking a deep inhale, every time the salted pistachios are set afire with raki, sending their anise scent through the dining room. I still thrill when the four-top at Table 9 are talking to one another so contentedly that they dont notice they are the last diners, lingering in the cocoon of the wine and the few shards of dark chocolate weve put down with their check. Even though I cant quite take part in it myself Im the boss, who must remain a little aloof from the crew I still quietly thrum with satisfaction when the kids are chattering away and hugging one another their hellos and how-are-yous in the hallway as they get ready for their shifts. But the very first time you cut a payroll check, you understand quite bluntly that, poetic notions aside, you are running a business. And that crew of knuckleheads you adore are counting on you for their livelihood. In the beginning I was closed on Mondays, ran only six dinner shifts and paid myself $425 a week. I got a very positive review in The New York Times, and thereafter we were packed. When I added a seventh dinner in 2000, I was able to hire a full-time sous chef. When I added weekend brunch, which started as a dreamy idea, not a business plan, it wound up being popular enough to let me buy out all six of the original investors. I turned 43 in 2008 and finally became the majority owner of my restaurant. I made my last student-loan payment and started paying myself $800 a week. A few years later, when I added lunch service on weekdays, it was a business decision, not a dream, because I needed to be able to afford health insurance for my staff, and I knew I could make an excellent burger. So suddenly, there we were: 14 services, seven days a week, 30 employees. It was a thrilling and exhausting first 10 years with great momentum. But Prune at 20 is a different and reduced quantity, now that there are no more services to add and costs keep going up. It just barely banks about exactly what it needs each week to cover its expenses. Ive joked for years that Im in the nonprofit sector, but that has been more direly true for several years now. This past summer, at 53, in spite of having four James Beard Awards on the wall, an Emmy on the shelf fromour PBS programand a best-selling book that has been translated into six languages, I found myself flat on my stomach on the kitchen floor in a painters paper coverall suit, maneuvering a garden hose rigged up to the faucet. Id poured bleach and Palmolive and degreaser behind the range and the reach-ins, trying to blast out the deep, dark, unreachable corner of the sauté station where lost egg shells, mussels, green scrubbies, hollow marrow bones, tasting spoons and cake testers, tongs and the occasional sizzle plate all get trapped and forgotten during service. Sign up to receive an email when we publish a new story about thecoronavirus outbreak. Sign Up There used to be enough extra money every year that I could close for 10 days in July to repaint and retile and rewire, but it has become increasingly impossible to leave even a few days of revenue on the table or to justify the expense of hiring a professional cleaning service for this deep clean that I am perfectly capable of doing myself, so I stayed late and did it after service. The sludge of egg yolk seeped through the coverall, through my clothes to my skin, matted my hair and speckled my goggles as my shock registered: It has always been hard, but when did it getthishard?\n\nTwo weeks afterwe closed, Ashley still had not got through to unemployment, and I had been thrice-thwarted by the auto-fill feature of the electronic form of the loan I was urged to apply for. I could start to see that things I had thought would be quick and uncomplicated would instead be steep and unyielding. No one was going to rescue me. I went into the empty restaurant for a bit each day to push back against the entropy a light bulb had died, a small freezer needed to be unplugged and restarted. Eleven envelopes arrived, bearing the unemployment notices from the New York State Department of Labor. The next stack of five arrived a week later. And then another six. The line of credit I thought would be so easy to acquire turned out to be one long week of harsh busy signals before I was even able to apply on March 25. I was turned down a week later, on April 1, because of inadequate business and personal cash flow. I howled with laughter over the phone at the underwriter and his explanation. Everything was uphill. Twenty-one days after we closed, Ashley still hadnt been able to reach unemployment. They now had a new system to handle the overload of calls: You call based on the first letter of your last name, and her next possible day would be a Thursday. If she didnt get through, she would have to wait until the next day allotted for all the Ms of the city. Links to low-interest S.B.A. disaster loans were circulated, but New York City wasnt showing up on the list of eligible zones. I emailed my accountant: This is weird? She wrote back with a sarcastic smiley emoticon:I believe it will be updated. Its the government they are only fast when they are collecting your taxes.The James Beard Foundation kicked into high gear and announced meaningful grants of up to $15,000 and with an application period that was supposed to last from March 30 to April 3, but within hours of opening, it was overwhelmed with applications and it had to stop accepting more. Ashley texted me from home that our dog was limping severely. This was the scenario that made me sweat: a medical emergency. We could live for a month on what was in the freezer, and I had a credit card that still had a $13,000 spending limit, but what if we got hurt somehow and needed serious medical care? Neither of us was insured. My kids are covered under their fathers policy, but there was no safety net for us. Among us chefs, there have been a hundred jokes over the decades about our medical (and veterinary) backup plans given our latex gloves and razor-sharp knives and our spotless stainless-steel prep tables but my sense of humor at that moment had become hard to summon. Meanwhile, my inbox was loaded with emails from everyone Ive ever known, all wanting to check in, as well as from colleagues around the country who were only now comprehending the scope of the impact on New Yorks restaurants. Hastily, fellow chefs and restaurant owners were forming groups, circulating petitions, quickly knitting coalitions for restaurant workers and suppliers and farmers. There were surveys to fill out, representatives to call, letters to sign. Some were turning their restaurants into meal kitchens to feed hospital workers. There was a relief bill before Congress that we were all urgently asked to support, but it puzzlingly left out small, independent restaurants even as it came through pretty nicely for huge chains and franchises. The other option, the Paycheck Protection Program, would grant you a loan with forgiveness, I learned, but only if you rehire your laid-off staff before the end of June. With no lifting of the mandatory shuttering and the Covid-19 death tolls still mounting, how could we rehire our staff? I couldnt really use the loan for what I needed: rent for the foreseeable future and the stack of invoices still haunting me in the office. And right when I started to feel backed against the ropes, I got a group email from a few concerned former Prune managers who eagerly offered to start a GoFundMe for Prune, inadvertently putting another obstacle in front of me: my own dignity. I sat on the email for a few days, roiling in a whole new paralysis of indecision. There were individual campaigns being run all over town to raise money to help restaurant staffs, but when I tried to imagine joining this trend, I couldnt overcome my pride at being seen as asking for a handout. It felt like a popularity contest or a survival-of-the-most-well-connected that I couldnt bring myself to enter. It would make me feel terrible if Prune was nicely funded while the Sikhs at the Punjabi Grocery and Deli down the street were ignored, and simultaneously crushed if it wasnt. I also couldnt quite imagine the ethical calculus by which I would distribute such funds: Should I split them equally, even though one of my workers is a 21-year-old who already owns his own apartment in Manhattan, while another lives with his unemployed wife and their two children in a rental in the Bronx? I thanked my former managers but turned them down: I had repeatedly checked in with my staff, and everybody was OK for now. It would be nigh impossible for me, in the context of a pandemic, to argue for the necessity of my existence. Do my sweetbreads and my Parmesan omelet count as essential at this time? In economic terms, I dont think I could even argue that Prune matters anymore, in a neighborhood and a city now fully saturated with restaurants much like mine, many of them better than mine some of which have expanded to employ as many as 100 people, not just cooks and servers and bartenders but also human-resource directors and cookbook ghostwriters. I am not going to suddenly start arguing the merits of my restaurant as a vital part of an industry or that I help to make up 2 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product or that I should be helped out by our government because I am one of those who employ nearly 12 million Americans in the work force. But those seem to be the only persuasive terms with my banks, my insurers, my industry lobbyists and legislators. I have to hope, though, that we matter in some other alternative economy; that we are still a thread in the fabric that might unravel if you yanked us from the weave.\n\nEverybodys saying that restaurantswont make it back, that we wont survive. I imagine this is at least partly true: Not all of us will make it, and not all of us will perish. But I cant easily discern the determining factors, even though thinking about which restaurants will survive and why has become an obsession these past weeks. What delusional mind-set am I in that I just do not feel that this is the end, that I find myself convinced that this is only a pause, if I want it to be? I dont carry investor debt; my vendors trust me; if my buildings co-op evicted me, they would have a beast of a time getting a new tenant to replace me. But I know few of us will come back as we were. And that doesnt seem to me like a bad thing at all; perhaps it will be a chance for a correction, as my friend, the chef Alex Raij, calls it. The conversation about how restaurants will continue to operate, given the rising costs of running them has been ramping up for years now; the coronavirus did not suddenly shine light on an unknown fragility. Weve all known, and for a rather long time. The past five or six years have been alarming. For restaurants, coronavirus-mandated closures are like the oral surgery or appendectomy you suddenly face while you are uninsured. These closures will take out the weakest and the most vulnerable. But exactly who among us are the weakest and most vulnerable is not obvious. Since Prune opened in the East Village, the neighborhood has changed tremendously in ways that reflect, with exquisite perfection, the restaurant scene as a whole. Within a 10-block radius of my front door, we have the more-than-100-year-old institutions Russ & Daughters and Katzs Delicatessen. We have hole-in-the-wall falafel, bubble tea and dumpling houses, and theres a steakhouse whose chef also operates a restaurant in Miami. Theres everyday sushi and rare, wildly expensive omakase sushi, as well as Japanese home cooking, udon specialists and soba shops. Theres a woman-owned and woman-run restaurant with an economic-justice mission that has eliminated tipping. Bobby Flay, perhaps the most famous chef on the Food Network, has an 125-seater two avenues over. We have farm-to-table concepts every three blocks, a handful of major James Beard Award winners and a dozen more shortlisted nominees and an impressive showing of New York Times one- and two-star earners, includingMadame Vo, a knockout Vietnamese restaurant just a few years old. Marco Canora, who started the countrys migration from regular old broth to what is now known by the name of his shop, Brodo, has published a couple of cookbooks and done a healthy bit of television in the course of his career. He still runs his only restaurant,17-year-old Hearth, on First Avenue. But block after block, for so many years now, there are storefronts where restaurants turn over so quickly that I dont even register their names. If Covid-19 is the death of restaurants in New York, will we be able to tell which restaurants went belly up because of the virus? Or will they be the same ones that would have failed within 16 months of opening anyway, from lack of wherewithal or experience? When we are sorting through the restaurant obituaries, will we know for sure that it was not because the weary veteran chef decided, as I have often been tempted myself in these weeks, to quietly walk out the open back door of a building that has been burning for a long time? It gets so confusing. Restaurant operators had already become oddly cagey, and quick to display a false front with each other. You asked, Hows business? and the answer always was, Yeah, great, best quarter weve ever had. But then the coronavirus hits, and these same restaurant owners rush into the public square yelling: Fire! Fire! They now reveal that they had also been operating under razor-thin margins. It instantly turns 180 degrees: Even famous, successful chefs, owners of empires, those with supremely wealthy investors upon whom you imagine they could call for capital should they need it, now openly describe in technical detail, with explicit data, how dire a position they are in. The sad testimony gushes out, confirming everything that used to be so convincingly denied.\n\nThe concerns before coronavirus are still universal: The restaurant as we know it is no longer viable on its own. You cant have tipped employees making $45 an hour while line cooks make $15. You cant buy a $3 can of cheap beer at a dive bar in the East Village if the dive bar is actually paying $18,000 a month in rent, $30,000 a month in payroll; it would have to cost $10. I cant keep hosing down the sauté corner myself just to have enough money to repair the ripped awning. Prune is in the East Village because Ive lived in the East Village for more than 30 years. I moved here because it was where you could get an apartment for $450 a month. In 1999, when I opened Prune, I still woke each morning to roosters crowing from the rooftop of the tenement building down the block, which is now a steel-and-glass tower. A less-than-500-square-foot studio apartment rents for $3,810 a month. The girl who called about brunch the first day we were closed probably lives there. She is used to having an Uber driver pick her up exactly where she stands at any hour of the day, a gel mani-pedi every two weeks and award-winning Thai food delivered to her door by a guy who braved the sleet, having attached oven mitts to his bicycle handlebars to keep his hands warm. But I know she would be outraged if charged $28 for a Bloody Mary. For the past 10 years Ive been staring wide-eyed and with alarm as the sweet, gentle citizen restaurant transformed into a kind of unruly colossal beast. The food world got stranger and weirder to me right while I was deep in it. The waiter became the server, the restaurant business became the hospitality industry, what used to be the customer became the guest, what was once your personality became your brand, the small acts of kindness and the way you always used to have of sharing your talents and looking out for others became things to monetize. The work itself cooking delicious, interesting food and cleaning up after cooking it still feels as fresh and honest and immensely satisfying as ever. Our beloved regulars and the people who work so hard at Prune are all still my favorite people on earth. But maybe its the bloat, the fetishistic foodies, the new demographic of my city who have never been forced to work in retail or service sectors. Maybe its the auxiliary industries that feed off the restaurants themselves the bloggers and agents and the influencers, the brand managers, the personal assistants hired just to keep you fresh on Insta, the Food & Wine festivals, the multitude of panels we chefs are now routinely invited to join, to offer our charming yet thoroughly unresearched opinions on. The proliferation of television shows and YouTube channels and culinary competitions and season after season of programming where you find yourself aghast to see an idol of yours stuffing packaged cinnamon buns into a football-shaped baking pan and squirting the frosting into a laces pattern for a tailgating episode on the Food Network. And God, the brunch, the brunch. The phone hauled out for every single pancake and every single Bloody Mary to be photographed and Instagrammed. That guy who strolls in and wont remove his sunglasses as he holds up two fingers at my hostess without saying a word: He wants a table for two. The purebred lap dogs now passed off as service animals to calm the anxieties that might arise from eating eggs Benedict on a Sunday afternoon. I want the girl who called the first day of our mandated shut down to call back, in however many months when restaurants are allowed to reopen, so I can tell her with delight and sincerity: No. We are not open for brunch. There is no more brunch.\n\nI, like hundredsof other chefs across the city and thousands around the country, are now staring down the question of what our restaurants, our careers, our lives, might look like if we can even get them back. I dont know whom to follow or what to think. Everyone says: You should do to-go! You should sell gift cards! You should offer delivery! You need a social media presence! You should pivot to groceries! You should raise your prices a branzino is $56 at Via Carota! I have thought for many long minutes, days, weeks of confinement and quarantine, should I? Is that what Prune should do and what Prune should become? I cannot see myself excitedly daydreaming about the third-party delivery-ticket screen I will read orders from all evening. I cannot see myself sketching doodles of the to-go boxes I will pack my food into so that I can send it out into the night, anonymously, hoping the poor delivery guy does a good job and stays safe. I dont think I can sit around dreaming up menus and cocktails and fantasizing about what would be on my playlist just to create something that people will order and receive and consume via an app. I started my restaurant as a place for people to talk to one another, with a very decent but affordable glass of wine and an expertly prepared plate of simply braised lamb shoulder on the table to keep the conversation flowing, and ran it as such as long as I could. If this kind of place is not relevant to society, then it we should become extinct.\n\nAnd yet even with the gate indefinitely shut against the coronavirus, Ive been dreaming again, but this time Im not at home fantasizing about a restaurant I dont even yet have the keys to. This time Ive been sitting still and silent, inside the shuttered restaurant I already own, that has another 10 years on the lease. I spend hours inside each day, on a wooden chair, in the empty clean space with the windows papered up, and I listen to the coolers hum, the compressor click on and off periodically, the thunder that echoes up from the basement as the ice machine drops its periodic sheet of thick cubes into the insulated bin. My body has a thin blue thread of electricity coursing through it. Sometimes I rearrange the tables. For some reason, I cant see wanting deuces anymore: No more two-tops? What will happen come Valentines Day? Its no mystery why this prolonged isolation has made me find the tiny 24-square-inch tables that Ive been cramming my food and my customers into for 20 years suddenly repellent. I want round tables, big tables, six-people tables, eight-tops. Early supper, home before midnight. Long, lingering civilized Sunday lunches with sun streaming in through the front French doors. I want old regulars to wander back into the kitchen while I lift the lids off the pots and show them what there is to eat. I want to bring to their tables small dishes of the feta cheese Ive learned to make these long idle weeks, with a few slices of thesaucisson secIve been hanging downstairs to cure while we wait to reopen, and to again hear Greg rattle the ice, shaking perfectly proportioned Vespers that he pours right to the rim of the chilled glass without spilling over. I have been shuttered before. With no help from the government, Prune has survived 9/11, the blackout, Hurricane Sandy, the recession, months of a city water-main replacement, online reservations systems you still have to call us on the telephone, and we still use a pencil and paper to take reservations! Weve survived the tyranny of convenience culture and the invasion of Caviar, Seamless and Grubhub. So Im going to let the restaurant sleep, like the beauty she is, shallow breathing, dormant. Bills unpaid. And see what she looks like when she wakes up so well rested, young all over again, in a city that may no longer recognize her, want her or need her.", "authors": ["Gabrielle Hamilton"], "publish_date": "2020/04/23"}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/2022/07/08/1110645654/ukrainians-have-a-special-place-in-their-hearts-for-boris-johnson", "title": "Ukrainians have a special place in their hearts for Boris Johnson ...", "text": "Ukrainians have a special place in their hearts for Boris Johnson\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/via AP Ukrainian Presidential Press Office/via AP\n\nMany Britons are happy to see Prime Minister Boris Johnson go, but he'll be sorely missed in Ukraine.\n\nJohnson was the first Western leader to visit Kyiv during the war, taking the train to meet Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy.

The bakery’s main dining room overlooks the Cathedral of the Assumption through a perimeter of picture windows that offer a view of the top of the bell tower down to the bicyclists and lemon-lime electric tramway that weave through the cobblestones below. The vista has quickly become a backdrop for influencers, like the young women in oversize blazers with a cherry juice in hand and a Marc Jacobs crossbody on the window bench who — living up to a certain eastern European stereotype — may be models, Ph.D. students, or both. Those same models might also be posing with Cheese Bakery’s most popular item, a round, coiled croissant that is a perfect match for the viral Suprêmes I watched people line up to try back home in New York.\n\nLviv is Ukraine’s westernmost “big” city, a half-day by train from the front lines, closer to Krakow than to Kyiv. There’s no fighting in the streets here, and Russian forces remain, between periodic missile and drone strikes, mostly out of sight. Aside from the air-raid sirens, a night out here recalls the ambition and aesthetics on display in downtown Manhattan: The pizzaiolo at Promin blends Ukrainian and imported Italian “00” flour for his pie crusts and bakes seasonal specials topped with wild asparagus, while an amateur lingerie model stirring negronis at Bar Over would probably be signed to No Agency if the upstairs hideaway were in Dimes Square instead of Stefana Yavorskoho Square.\n\nMy decision last fall to begin reporting on the food world here — really a series of small, increasingly consequential decisions — began with stalking Ukrainian chefs and bartenders on social media and hitting up their DMs with the help of Google Translate, before booking a flight to Krakow and a car over the border. I had previously interviewed José Andrés while reporting on World Central Kitchen’s efforts in Ukraine, but I wanted to see the other side of eating here, how bars and kitchens operating under a vague specter of death, hustle to make every meal count for the city’s 700,000 residents.\n\nCheese Bakery. Photo: Adam Robb\n\nI was an hour late to my first meeting with Tatiana Mykytyn, Cheese Bakery’s owner, and Kate Kraus, the head baker. What I thought at first was an unpredictable snarl of traffic on the road into town turned out to be the opposite: a regular occurrence. My driver slowed to a halt and we stepped outside to see a passing funeral procession that soon occupied the opposite lane. Priests and congregation, a band in army uniforms, and a grieving family bookended a hearse driving no faster than the children following behind it.\n\nThe country was not like this when Mykytn and her husband, Andriy, started their bakery in 2018 to sell cheesecakes. “When we were married, we used the money relatives gave us as capital for the first location,” Mykytyn says. The second location opened overlooking Cathedral Square in 2020, two months into the COVID pandemic. “We pivoted to a delivery model two days later, and it’s been a large part of our business ever since,” Mykytyn recalls. “We were scheduled to open our third location on February 24, 2022” — the day of the Russian invasion. “We held a soft opening the day before, and stocked the cases, and on opening day, everyone sheltered. It was another three weeks before we tried again.”\n\nBy then, the pulse of the city had quickened, and in came a flood of immigrants from the east, some displaced and in search of a hot meal, work, or both. “Employees left to go abroad, while we hired those who just moved here looking for work,” Mykytn says. It was Kate Kraus, who’d come from Kyiv before the invasion, that conceived Cheese Bakery’s iteration of the Suprême croissant immediately after it went viral in the U.S. The self-taught pastry chef had always used social media to track bakeries around the world: Lune Croissanterie in Melbourne, Pophams in London, or Supermoon and Lafayette in New York. Upon first seeing the Suprême, she got to work. “My first thought was, Oh my God, we need that! and then we thought, When is better than now?” Kraus tells me. “It was a new idea to our country and we wanted to make them first.”\n\nAt that time, Kraus had been working with Cheese Bakery for more than a year, while simultaneously running her own custom bakery, Kombinat, which continues to operate daily in Kyiv; she makes a weekly commute — a five-hour train each way — between the two cities. While Kraus juggles multiple kitchens, Mykytn runs Cheese Bakery’s social accounts. “We did a survey on Instagram, and guests came up with the name,” Mykityn says. “Here it’s called a kravlyk. It’s a combination of croissant and ravlyk, the Ukrainian word for snail.”\n\nAfter a few days of experimentation and tracking down advice online, Kraus nailed the pastry, and went to work on the fillings; best sellers include pistachio, lime pineapple coconut, basil black currant, and Nutella. Cheese Bakery sells around 80 of its $3.65 kravlyks — about one-third of the price at Lafayette — per day, a quarter of the bakery’s daily pastry sales.\n\n“After two years, I’ve come to understand that everything can change in one second and you have to be ready for everything,” Kraus says. She navigated country-wide blackouts when there weren’t enough generators to go around: The daytime team tasked with cheesecakes and overnight pastry teams would together wait out whole days for the power to return, sustaining themselves on tea and instant noodles, water boiled on gas camping stoves. “During the winter it was cold enough that we could keep our ingredients fresh outside when our refrigerators were down, and we’d huddle together and make up songs so we didn’t lose our minds,” Kraus recalls. “Too often we’d have to mix ingredients by hand, and we’d have contests to see who could whip cream fastest to keep us motivated. Today, nobody in our kitchen can be intimidated by anything.”\n\nBaking with no heat and now power. Photo: Kate Kraus\n\nKraus recalled her team working under the most severe conditions in the autumn and winter of 2022, the start of the rocket attacks against critical infrastructure around Lviv. “I think we were more concerned about our product than for our lives,” she says. “We had the most incredible team spirit, and working through the attacks was the least we could do to show our strength.” (Kraus has recently turned her attention to overstuffed cream puffs following a tasting trip that brought her to Nordic bakeries like Buka in Copenhagen; while Ukrainian men between 18 and 60 years old are barred from leaving the country, women may freely come and go. “I tried to get a visa to the U.S. to taste your croissants, but I was refused,” Kraus says.)\n\nI emailed Lafayette pastry chef Scott Cioe to see what he thought about the kravlyks, and he gave a seal of approval: “A big reason why I’m drawn to working in bakeries is that you can make something everyone can enjoy.” Mykytyn says she’s seen other bakeries adopt their own versions, as well. “After us, many bakeries in Ukraine launched their own round croissant, they’ve even called it kravlyk,” she says.\n\n“Baking is more than a distraction,” Kraus adds. “It’s a way to produce something beautiful in the midst of so much horror, pain, and anger.”\n\nKravlyks, lined up for service.

It was parked along the street next to the Caltrain railway line, close to where I was shacking up with my dear friend Amy, a sweet Taiwanese woman working for Apple. I spent a lot of time in Mountain View, using it as my base for several years. It had an amazing second hand bookshop, which unfortunately closed a few years ago. Just across the street is an amazing Hong Kong bakery for the best pastries.\n\nMy phone lit up. An unusual email landed on my notifications. It contained a summons to the Federal Reserve in San Francisco.\n\nOut of the blue, someone who had been reading my books had noticed that I was in the Bay Area from a social media message I’d posted. He worked in the research section of the federal Reserve and he was enthused about my books on Promise Theory and Smart Spacetime. He wanted to meet me since I was in the area. Ironically, although many of my friends had been generally scathing about my books–particularly the more philosophical ones–those books were responsible for getting me attention and actual work more times than anything else. I replied that he could call me on my mobile phone number. Within seconds he called and we arranged for me to drive from Mountain View into central San Francisco near the Embarcadero where the Fed was situated.\n\nI was a bit shocked and a bit excited by the email. Nonetheless, I drove the fifty or so miles into town and followed his instructions to enter the secure car park where visitors could park. The high fences and layers of security guards let me pass cheerily and I was granted a guided tour and a bite to eat. My host was excited by the possibilities for semantic spacetime and had enjoyed what I’d written about micro-currencies. It gave me a warm feeling to know that someone had noticed the very esoteric work I’d tried to do to formalise concepts about money and ownership. The work I’d done on money had been a strange turn.\n\nAfter discovering Promise Theory and commissioning a book about it, Tim O’Reilly took some interest in what I wrote for a while. O’Reilly read my essay on Banks, Brains, and Factories and shared it with a well known economist friend. I promised to show them my notes as well as to Mike Loukides at O’Reilly publishing, who had been writing about these topics. The first draft turned out to be 80 pages long. Mike replied: “My god, you don’t do anything by halves do you?” But I was only half done!\n\nI’d stumbled across a book by Keith Hart called The Memory Bank. The idea that money could be a memory bank and a communication network seemed ahead of its time. But this was exactly what Promise Theory predicted. Naively excited as always, I reached out to the author to express my enthusiasm for the book. He replied graciously and asked me to send a draft of what I was writing. When he saw my draft text, Hart was brutally scathing and derisive. How was this anything like what he had written? His ideas were political, mine were some pointless mathematics. It was a slap in the face, but as I delved into economic writings, I realised that so much of it was political rather than scholarly. I wanted to do better than spouting opinion, no matter how intuitively correct.\n\nAfter some comments from Jan Bergstra, I decided that we could turn the 80 page analysis into a book. After all, when a document gets that long, it needs an index and a structure that allows you to flip through it, otherwise no one would be able to read it. Jan was mildly interested on a philosophical level, though he was more interested at the time in the implications of Islamic finance and its interest free lending. Still, he rubber stamped my work and did some critical proofreading. I worked out the details of what ownership can mean from a network perspective. That felt like an important step that everyone thus far had taken for granted, Money, Ownership, and Agency was published in 2019.\n\nIt seemed clear that economics was one area where Promise Theory ought to rule. The new forms of money that were coming into being, from flight miles to Bitcoin were dominated by the cryptocurrency movement, but I wasn’t convinced that it made sense. My limited understanding of money was that it relied in many ways on centralization for its security.\n\nThe excellent used book shop, now recycled into a shops\n\nThe development of Promise Theory took a number of turns over the years. I was always conscious of the fact that there were very few predictions offered by the theory, and that needed to change. Jan Bergstra had been intrigued by the concept of Islamic Financing and had written a couple of papers on the topic. I, in turn, had become interested in the economics of the Market Crash in 2008 and subsequent twists and turns, and had begun to read anything I could on the topic.\n\nI wrote an essay about the likeness between agents in a cognitive model and an economic model, showing how the key part of these systems was the memory boundary. I felt this was sort of what Keith Hart had been getting at, but he wasn’t able to see the larger picture. I wrote up the essay for a keynote speech I was invited to give at the inaugural opening of a new conference called All Day Devops, for an audience of 30,000 people online! Brains, Banks, and Factories 2017 got some nice comments from a range of people and was interviewed on a podcast about the article. The article would later become a book.\n\nThe meeting at the Fed didn’t result in any direct work. You need a much higher profile than I have to get on the radar of money men. Also, money men are the ones who have the least amount of money to offer others when it comes to paying for something! For them, money travels in one direction only. Nevertheless, like my other books, the money book attracted a small but select fan base and continues to do so today. A man wrote to me from Australia to tell me how he admired the work, and one the Tim O’Reilly’s economist friends promised to read the book after seeing my popular essay.\n\nI’m fortunate to have the attention of these random strangers. Without their feedback, I would certainly have given up long ago.\n\nDad\n\nI’d been asked to move to the Bay Area several times by different companies, including my own company and Apple. Not moving too far from my family turned out to be a good move, however. I was between trips, travelling between China and the US to work on different projects when it finally happened. I was at home in Norway when my dad collapsed one day from a stroke. He’d tried to get out of bed, but lay on the floor unconscious for most of a day before his new wife returned home from her job and found him. She called me in a panic.\n\nHis recent marriage to a Chinese-Japanese woman half his age meant that there was someone in the house to find him as he keeled over getting out of bed. Grace, his wife, called me immediately, as the ambulance was on its way. I called my sister and I began to plan a flight to England. I flew to the UK to see him in the hospital. He was paralysed on his left side and it took some weeks to recover his speech, but he was as defiant as ever.\n\nHe wasn’t an easy patient. He denied his injuries and was constantly planning his prison break. It was hard to tell whether he truly believed that he was fine, or whether he was just in complete denial. He’d always been an expert liar, whose first instinct was to make up a story rather than confront the truth of any issue. When I saw him, he would ask me to push him in a wheelchair to the car and make a prison break to go back home. I felt terrible for him. His home was his life,\n\nAlthough we had never understood one another, I later came to realise that we were similarly introverted. His overtly confrontational nature in public, but personable manner to friends, concealed that for a long time, but I believe that he ultimately preferred to hide away at home. He never went out by choice, except for a famous coffee with friends, after the separation from my mum. I learned this too late though.\n\nHe spent two years in hospital and a fairly nice country care home that we selected for him, deteriorating gradually and entirely unhappy. It meant that I was travelling more to the UK than I had done in many years. In some ways, it became easier for me to visit than before the stroke, because I no longer had to deal with the politics of who to visit and who to stay with. I could finally relax about visiting my mum. I got to know my mum better again, after a long distancing.\n\nThe stroke was a tragic episode that I was spared from dealing with, at first hand, thanks to his wife’s brave determination to look after him.\n\nBecause we were never close, in spite of trying, I didn’t feel his loss greatly until later, after my mum died. We had never been close, but it took a while to feel the regret of not having known one another better. I’m not sure it was anyone’s fault, and I feel awful that it must have been harder on him. Feeling estranged from one’s child, after all, must be heartbreaking.\n\nNew York again\n\nOn the trip I’d taken to New York for the Transition conference in 2015, I met my friend Tamar Eilam for lunch in Bryant park, just a couple of blocks away from the conference venue. We’d known each other tangentially for years through the Networking conference circuit, and had met semi-romantically a couple of times.\n\nShe worked at Watson Labs, currently in the news for its much publicised AI Jeopardy Competition win. As Artificial Intelligence began to rear its head again, she told me that IBM wanted to recruit top people strategically. From my experiences with large companies, I wasn’t too excited about the idea of being owned by a monster like IBM, but I knew several people there that I liked. She persuaded me to try out a project with an eye perhaps to possibly hiring me later.\n\nAfter a bit of administrative back and forth, I was connected to another friend Nico whom I’d known from the same conferences all the way back to 2001. We agreed on a budget and a vague project description and I was asked to come to Watson and meet with some of the bosses. It should have been a warning flag that the project was ill-defined at the outset, but I’d worked with other companies like Cisco and Huawei under similar scenarios and they had been completely fine. When I arrived, I learned that I wasn’t going to work with any of the people I knew. Someone has decided that I should be placed with a team of unknown researchers, managed by Nico. I wasn’t sure what to make of that, but trod carefully to find the lay of the land.\n\nThe group was nice enough: a woman and a young Indian man, with random drop ins from folks we both knew. They seemed to be as bemused as I was to be thrown together without much planning. What exactly did we want to do? I explained a bit about the work I’d been doing on knowledge management and semantic spacetime. I talked about smart sensors at the edge of the network to avoid massive data collection. They were polite and we suggested trying to implement something like this for cloud management. We were going to need data to analyze.\n\nAt first, my friend Nico came to supervise the sessions, but he was pulled away into something else. As the project started, I was placed with a small group of junior to mid level researchers who had no idea who I was or why I was joining them. They were busy with existing projects and weren’t invested in working together at all. This is the corporate life that I wasn’t keen to join.\n\nThe team members were already busy with other work they were invested in and didn’t take the time to understand my ideas. I spent some time making videos and writing papers to explain the background material, but while they nodded one day it was clear that they were just being polite. They saw the project as something that I was going to do for them. Fair enough. I hoped to get some data to work on a smart analysis using knowledge maps, but no one had any data to use. “Of course we have data,” they said, but nothing came. Finally, I received a file of junk data from IBM’s cloud, which was a testament to the poor state of monitoring today. It was terabytes of junk, like licence files dumped to public logging services once per second by some open source packages. It was a facepalm moment, but no one there really cared. They just wanted to get on with what they were doing before I arrived.\n\nI felt bad for them, but they started to needle me about coming up with results without contributing anything themselves, not even the data that I was supposed to analyse. That wasn’t what I signed up for. I was irritated that I was supposed to be a kind of expert consultant to lead an initiative, but they treated me as a hired gun. I went back to Oslo with an official laptop that I was supposed to use. It was a Thinkpad, which had Microsoft Windows installed and all the corporate authentication junk that follows with big companies. I’d already messed up my Macintosh installing a similar software agent from Cisco so I was dreading having to use it. In practice I couldn’t use it at all except to read some emails. I needed Linux to use my programming tools.\n\nI worked on some code to sample the data we were expecting to get, by modifying by fork of the CFEngine open source under the name Cellibrium. I sent them the code, but no one knew how to make and compile software. I made elaborate instructions and come videos to explain, and they were eventually able to make some progress, but the fact remained that they were doing it against their will. Months passed and another trip was arranged to Watson.\n\nSnowstorm in Midtown Manhattan\n\nThe second trip was hit by a huge Winter storm that closed the airport just after I landed. The city shut down and I was trapped in my hotel for the first day. On the second day I was given instructions to get the train out of the city where someone picked me up and drove me to Watson, but few people had come to work. It was a huge waste of time and money.\n\nAs the meetings came to the conclusion that we had no viable data to study, I generated some test data of my own to show how the knowledge inference could work. By the end of the session, there was grudging acceptance of the ideas I’d tried to present, but still no buy in from the team. The mood was already soured.\n\nIt was the worst possible arrangement and it quickly fell apart. As an outsider, I had no authority to decide anything, and they had no interest in the work. I became angry and they became angry. In the end it ended with some bitter words. The project was already out of money, so it was decided to give up! The department administrator asked me how I thought it had gone and if I would consider working with IBM again. I cautiously said, “maybe” if the right thing came up–but it was clear that neither of us were looking forward to that. It was a bizarre episode but I was determined not to let it be for nothing.\n\nAround that time, I went back to China for another project with Huawei. At least, working with the Chinese, I knew that everyone had the respect to listen to the people they invited. Of course, they were also a large company and large companies rarely succeed at innovation internally.\n\nConcepts from text\n\nI thought about going back to develop the machine learning methods for monitoring but realized that there were some big gaps in the understanding of the problem. I drafted a couple of papers about system statelessness and observability of phenomena from a distributed systems perspective. These papers got a surprising amount of attention on Twitter. I wrote them in response to the latest marketing appropriation of well understood concepts in IT. I was even a little irritated by people professing to reinvent issues they didn’t even understand properly. It was a good exercise to force myself to write down the concepts formally in Promise Theory. Indeed, the work formed the basis for a second volume of notes about systems. I eventually turned these notes into my two volume Treatise on Systems.\n\nBut I didn’t want to be stuck in the past. I wanted to get back to problems that would move my knowledge research forward. I’d just been treating water to get others to join in at IBM. If getting data was the problem for machine learning, then how could I find data that I didn’t need to rely on anyone for? I came up with the idea of reading books. The Internet surely has a lot of text. Surely I could use that to develop some of the ideas. But the more I thought about the original idea, the more I realized that I could use all of the concepts from Semantic Spacetime to develop a scaled model of the conceptualization. I just needed to do the work in detail to prove the point. I needed to get my hands dirty with data analysis.\n\nI read some books on Natural Language Processing and decided that none of them were doing what I wanted to do. I developed some methods of performing n-gram fractionation of text. It was based on my old ideas of Computer Immunology.\n\nI had an idea, based on linguistic interpretation of space and time as a process (basically the Chomsky hierarchy or the Turing tape) that concepts were the long term scaled evolution of fragments of pattern acquired from spacetime cognition. The idea was obvious from the viewpoint of promise theory and semantic spacetime interpretation. I’d said as much in the original papers, but it was hard to see in practice. It needed a proof of concept.\n\nI returned to my systematic approach and began to build a model from the bottom up. It was arduous work, but also pleasantly practical. It had been a while since I’d done any programming. Now I could learn Golang for this new project and get to see exactly how everything worked at first hand–just from my laptop. One thing I was adamant about was that I would not pursue giant models that needed hundred of cloud computers to solve. For one thing, I couldn’t afford to do that. More importantly, I wanted to place understanding first. I wanted to see how much could be inferred from just small patterns–the way small brained animals work. This is how evolution finds its way.\n\nAfter a few months of working and writing, filling note books as well as databases with ideas and calculations, I had enough structure to define the problem and draw some conclusions. I wrote a first paper on the statistical meaning of intent from patterns, and a second paper on the emergence of concepts by scaling stable meanings. It was fascinating to discover that the concepts I could find were nothing close to linguistic notions of things or ideas, but rather more primitive colours of emotional “feelings”. What is Moby Dick about? Not whales, as it turns out. It’s about anger and obsession. That was the result of the analysis.\n\nI learned a lot by doing this work, and the results were definitely suggestive of the idea that I was trying to demonstrate. Ultimately, however, the results from such a small scale experiment were not conclusive enough to go very far, so the key questions remained open. But it was not in vain. Later, I would come back to revisit these ideas–after developing some interim concepts–in connection with two later project works on neuroscience and on trust.\n\nStrokes of misfortune\n\nIn the midst of this travelling, I was trying to go back to the UK regularly, visiting my Dad whenever I could. By this time, he was deteriorating from his stroke and subsequent microstrokes and barely recognized me. It was tragic to see him like this, refusing to eat, and so filled with sadness. Even now, in the midst of his fear of death and unhappily wasting away, he didn’t really want to see me. He would send me away shortly after I arrived. Perhaps he didn’t want anyone to see him in that condition. I could only regret that we were never able to bridge the gap between the two of us and understand each other better.\n\nMadrid airport\n\nThat summer, I was recruited to be a part of an advisory board for a large Spanish Bank called BBVA. It was a lovely arrangement, set up by an American go-between advisory company. They offered a generous amount of money to have four meetings and I jumped at the chance. It seemed like manna from heaven.\n\nI love working for bankers and financiers. They fly you business class and fetch you in limousines. I was one of four “experts” brought in, mainly from the USA, to advise on technology. I was so enthusiastic that I put off some work for Huawei in order to be sure to keep their meeting schedule. That turned out to be a mistake.\n\nThe BBVA people were lovely, but I had the sense that this was a management initiative that the tech folks hadn’t agreed to. That also quickly fell apart, which was a shame. I’d been looking forward to the meetings, and I’d out off other projects to make room for it. I ended up losing several months of money due to the cancellation, which set off a chain of poor finances for years in which money became very tight.\n\nL days–serendipity\n\nI was suddenly 50 years old, and it felt as though half my life had been wasted unsuccessfully on things I hadn’t been able to finish, as well as people I’d not been able to know properly. I’d resigned myself to the idea that I wasn’t ever going to meet a partner as someone who would accept me for who I was. Likewise, whom I could accept having pushed people away for so long. But then, just when I thought it was a done deal, out of the blue, I did.\n\nFor years, I’d been in a kind of relationship purgatory. A darker episode in my life had compelled me to support someone close to me, an addict who could be both emotionally demanding and occasionally violent and threatening both to me and others. I could expect visits to my door at any hour of day or night, demanding attention. If I didn’t behave properly, emotions would fly out of control. I had to be careful about inviting anyone into my home. I went to Japan with cracked ribs in 2010 and lived with the constant threat of jealous rage. I was afraid to expose anyone else to this potential jeopardy, and so my romantic relationships were always opportunistic, secretive, and necessarily tenuous.\n\nFor the most part, I succeeded in stealing moments of adventure, but it felt unfair not being able to explain my dismissive behaviour to the beautiful liaisons that I dated. Everyone I did steal moments with had to be precious to me to risk the consequences. Some of them merely used me too, of course, some had emotional issues of their own. Still, I cherished all those memories and I carry them with me every day. I hope they don’t judge me too harshly.\n\nOne day all that fear and trepidation came to an end, when my dark shadow turned a corner and moved on. I was suddenly free of obligations–released from the unintended captivity that had hung over me for more than a decade. I was granted a second life, just as I was feeling ready to give up on the one I’d already had.\n\nI didn’t exactly rush out to marry the first suitor–indeed, marriage was never on my list of interests. Instead of going out hunting for a mate, I shut the doors and hardly spoke to anyone. Exhausted by the years of work and by juggling too many personal issues, I’d given up wanting to be close to anyone. But no one can deny loneliness. No matter how you try, it lingers and haunts.\n\nOn a trip to Paris I met a lovely Phillipino girl, smart and sexy. I dated and travelled with her for a while. She was lonely too in a different way and worked (a little too hard) to turn us into a couple for several years, but we weren’t a good match. Our needs didn’t overlap. She was an irrepressible extrovert and needed a level of energy I couldn’t muster. Like the friendship I’d just escaped from, it placed more expectations on my shoulders, but I was already spent. I tried to turn it into something more casual, but that left some wounds. At this point I wasn’t sure I wanted anything except casual liaisons.\n\nI tried Tinder for a while, and met a few nice women, but it felt fake and it was stressful to my introvert nature. After talking to a friend in New York, I checked out a website for connections that she had recommended out of sheer desperation. The very first face I saw turned out to be a young Chinese girl who went by the Western name of Lynn.\n\nSpeedboats passing in flight\n\nLynn had posted an unusually honest set of pictures from her travels, featuring her art and her fashion. It wasn’t the usual cheesy vanity poses. She seemed to be travelling alone, as many Chinese girls do. I was moved to compliment her on the pictures, thinking no more would come of it. Unexpectedly, she replied and we began to chat.\n\nBy chance she was travelling to Spain (Barcelona) to Oslo. And by chance I was travelling from Oslo to Spain (Madrid). One picture had her posing in a hotel somewhere for a humorous Instagram moment that just broke my heart. The picture felt so lonely that I wanted to open my heart to her and rescue her in whatever way I could. She was far too young to be as lonely as I was, and apparently for similar reasons. Of all the women I’d been privileged to know, this meeting of minds drew me to her more than anything. It seemed like we could understand each other.\n\nBy coincidence as I was travelling from Oslo to Spain, she was travelling from Spain to Oslo! It was a ridiculous coincidence. We crossed paths without even meeting in person and kept going. Our journeys were both long since planned and going in completely opposite directions, and yet we bonded somehow–perhaps sensing compatible values and compatible longings. We started to chat regularly on WhatsApp, falling into an easy style of sharing pictures of where we were, so that we were virtually together all the time. It wasn’t a relationship based primarily on attraction, but on familiarity. We could speak, make video calls, but mostly we would chat.\n\nIn her art, what struck me was that both of us had created worlds inside our own minds of fun and of darkness. Our problems seemed to lie not in being alone, but being with others. I saw a kindred spirit. An artist, a writer, a stylish and playful spirit. Someone running from her life. Mostly, I saw someone who was as profoundly lonely as I was, and trying to hide it–but not too well. My heart broke for her. I knew we could be friends.\n\nShe went to New York, and I flew back to Oslo, and helped her in some minor ways to navigate the city by chat. Then she went to Boston, which was tantalising. I was going to Boston too, but not for another month! In the end, after some time travelling, I think she felt the depth of her unhappiness alone, on the run, and decided to fly back to China. Ironically, her home was Shenzhen just across the water from Hong Kong–the two cities in China where I’d worked, and that I knew well.\n\nI promised her that I would come to her. It felt like my last chance. I’d found a kindred spirit when I wasn’t looking–someone it felt natural to communicate with. From half a planet away, she was only half my age, but if that’s what it took, then so be it. She told me later that she didn’t really believe that I would come, but I was never in any doubt. This was likely my last chance. It was only when I showed her the plane ticket that it raised an eyebrow. Are there people who do what they say? I had a date!\n\nBut, I had several promises to keep before that. I had to fly to Paris to give a keynote–another rendition of Banks, Brains, and Factories. Then I had to fly to Boston for my final LISA conference. I returned to Oslo and had only a few days to wash and recoup. Then I jumped on the plane to Hong Kong, right before Christmas.\n\nI took BA’s giant A380 airbus to Hong Kong. via London, treating myself to business class to survive the 12 hour flight. I wasn’t going to save pennies on this trip. On the plane, I watched the latest Star Trek movie and hated it, but at the end there was a song by Rihanna that instantly grabbed me: Sledgehammer. To this day, that song fills my stomach with butterflies for our first meeting.\n\nLynn met me at the Hong Kong arrivals gate. We’ve been together ever since.\n\nLandmark christmas\n\nThe Landmark shopping centre in HK\n\nI was 50 years old. Lynn was half my age, and from half a planet away, but we clicked almost straight away and we’ve been together ever since. We spent days in Hong Kong, and crossed into Shenzhen, as I still had my Chinese visa. We walked, we ate cake, and looked at Hong Kong’s world famous Christmas decorations. I’ve never felt so comfortable with someone so quickly. No expectations, no demands, just walking hand in hand.\n\nTsim Sha Tsui park\n\nI left Hong Kong on Christmas Eve and flew back to London. Lynn found a job for a few weeks over the New Year, but found it hard to adjust to life back in Shenzhen. After just a few weeks, she quit the job and told me she was coming to Oslo. It was the best news I could imagine. I quickly bought a new sofa to spruce up the apartment and made some welcome decorations.\n\nDeath and taxes\n\nAs Lynn flew back to Oslo to be with me, the news came that my Dad had died. I took it with great ambivalence. His misery was finally over, but what had I done to prevent it?\n\nWe had to fly to the UK almost immediately for his funeral. Within days of arriving in Oslo, we had to fly to the UK. Although we hardly knew each other, I knew her better than people I’d known half my life. Luckily she had a visa for the UK. We booked a hotel in Banbury and went straight to my mum’s.\n\nLynn was the first person I’d ever taken to visit my mum. That didn’t escape her notice. They bonded instantly. Lynn’s sense of humour was very much like the humour on my mother’s side of the family–silly and playful. That’s one side of (mainland) Chinese people that I was always drawn to from the beginning. The sense of humour is very compatible with British humour, and Lynn’s humour is very compatible with our family’s.\n\nImagine, to have someone who genuinely cares for you.
